       "\"     Monthly\\n            Economic\\n            Review\\n            May\\n            2021\\n            Economic \\n            Division1\\n            Abstract\\n            Provisional GDP estimates now available for January-March quarter (Q4) of FY 2020-21 confirm a \\n            V-shaped recovery in India’s economic prospects in the second half of the year after an unprecedented \\n            COVID-19 induced contraction. India’s real GDP is estimated to grow at 0.5 per cent in Q3 and 1.6 \\n            per cent in Q4 of FY 2020-21 leading to an upward revision in annual real GDP growth from (-)8.0 \\n            per cent (2nd Advance Estimates) to (-)7.3 per cent in FY 2020-21. Gross value added (GVA) at basic \\n            prices for FY 2020-21 is estimated to grow at (-)6.2 per cent with agriculture & allied activities lending \\n            its unwavering support for economic recovery throughout the year. Given the large contribution of \\n            subsidies in Q3 and Q4, estimated GVA growth of 1.6 per cent in Q3 and 3.7 per cent in Q4 is more \\n            representative of economic performance in the second half of FY 2020-21. India is one of the select few \\n            economies that have witnessed positive YoY growth in the last two consecutive quarters.\\n            With a strong policy focus on infrastructure spending and construction in latter half of FY 2020-21, the \\n            ratio of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) to GDP reached 34.3 per cent, among the highest in \\n            over twenty-six quarters. Also, construction rebounded to grow at 14.5 per cent in Q4. As economic \\n            activity resumed following gradual unlocking and policy support, private consumption grew at 2.7 per \\n            cent after falling for three consecutive quarters. Moreover, contact-intensive hotels, trade and transport \\n            sectors contracted by only 2.3 per cent in Q4 after large declines in previous quarters. \\n            This momentum of economic recovery has, however, been moderated by the ravaging second wave of \\n            COVID-19. Unlike the first wave, the effect of the second wave has been asynchronous in its onset \\n            across states and wider in its spread as the second wave also entered the rural hinterland. This \\n            necessitated a differentiated, state-level policy response in close coordination with the Central \\n            Government for rapid rebooting of health infrastructure and effective implementation of ‘Test, Track, \\n            Treat, Vaccinate and COVID-appropriate behaviour’. A continuous decline in the 7-day average of \\n            active cases since 13th May 2021 and the 7-day average of daily new cases after 8th May marked the \\n            declining phase of the second wave. \\n            Simultaneously, the world’s largest vaccination drive is underway in India with 23.9 crore doses \\n            administered as on date. To avoid or lower the ferocity of subsequent waves, an accelerated vaccination \\n            drive is imperative. Vaccinating to achieve herd immunity (75-80 per cent of the population) will boost \\n            consumer and producer confidence and reinvigorate the engines of economic growth. For this purpose, \\n            challenges pertaining to vaccine supply, vaccine hesitancy, operational aspects to achieve high daily \\n            throughput, and widespread reach must be anticipated and planned for in advance.\\n            After declining during the second wave. high frequency indicators such as power consumption, E-way \\n            bills and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows witnessed uptick in the second half of May 2021. \\n            Agriculture sector continues to offer comfortable prospects amidst a normal monsoon forecast, smooth \\n            food procurement and distribution, and MGNREGA employment. However, sequential slackening was \\n            observed in eight core industrial output, PMI manufacturing, steel consumption, auto sales, tractor \\n            sales, petroleum products consumption, rail freight, port and air traffic, PMI services, highway toll \\n            collections, GST collections and UPI transactions. \\n            CPI inflation eased to 4.3 per cent in April 2021 (as against 7.2 per cent in April 2020) from 5.5 per \\n            cent in March 2021 driven by decline in food inflation and a favorable base effect. Going forward, the \\n            trajectory for CPI inflation may derive comfort from the forecast of a normal south-west monsoon but\\n            remains vulnerable to pressures arising from high international commodity prices and logistics costs \\n            across manufacturing and services. WPI inflation, however, increased to 10.5 per cent in April 2021 as \\n            compared to 7.4 per cent in March 2021 on account of increase in inflation of all major groups, viz, \\n            Primary articles, Fuel & power and Manufactured products and base effect.2\\n            On the external front, exports grew at 7.9 per cent in May 2021 over pre-COVID May 2019 levels, \\n            thereby reflecting export resilience amidst global economic recovery. However, domestic demand \\n            prospects remained tentative with imports declining by 17.5 per cent. India emerged as the preferred \\n            investment destination, attracting highest ever FDI inflow of USD 81.7 billion during the pandemic \\n            year FY 2020-21, particularly in computer software & hardware and infrastructure sectors. Bolstered \\n            by resurgent net foreign inflows, easing of the second wave and weakening dollar, the Indian Rupee \\n            made a strong comeback in May 2021 to reach INR/USD 72.8 and became the best performing Asian \\n            currency in the month. \\n            On the monetary side, money supply continued to rise by 9.9 per cent (YoY) as on 21st May 2021 driven \\n            by growth in aggregate deposits. Monthly growth in currency-in-circulation (CiC) which had begun to \\n            moderate in the second half of FY 20-21 picked up again in April and May 2021, suggestive of rise in \\n            precautionary demand for cash during the second wave, albeit lower than first wave levels. Bank credit \\n            YoY growth continued to remain muted at 6.0 per cent as on 21st May 2021. Growth of non-food credit \\n            at over 12.4 per cent over the corresponding period in FY 2019-20 is noteworthy given the policy\\x02driven focus on private investment. \\n            Financial conditions in May 2021 have remained conducive for economic recovery with systemic \\n            liquidity in surplus, continued accommodative monetary policy stance – as outlined in June 4 Monetary \\n            Policy statement - and unhindered efforts towards smooth policy transmission. To mitigate challenges \\n            of the second wave, RBI has further unveiled developmental and regulatory measures to ensure \\n            equitable liquidity support for affected sectors and financial stability. \\n            India’s dynamic public debt management strategy and RBI’s artillery of conventional and \\n            unconventional instruments like G-SAP 1.0 has enabled Central and State governments to meet their \\n            increasing financial needs amid the pandemic at low costs of borrowing and manageable levels of risk. \\n            The 10-year G-Sec yield stayed below 6 per cent despite the uncertainty engendered by the second wave. \\n            Corporate bond yields largely tracked G-sec market movements, reflecting policy rate transmission to \\n            corporate bond market and surplus liquidity conditions. Primary corporate bond market issuances \\n            increased by 13.4 per cent to a record Rs. 7.8 lakh crore during FY 2020-21. \\n            Driven by buoyant and broad-based growth in Centre's net revenue collections of 5.9 per cent for 2020-\\n            21 Provisional Actuals (PA) over 2020-21 Revised Estimates (RE) and nearly 5 per cent growth over \\n            2019-20, Centre's fiscal deficit for FY 2020-21 stood at 9.2 per cent of GDP for 2020-21 (PA), 0.3 \\n            percentage points lower than RE. Quality of expenditure crucially improved with capex in FY 2020-\\n            21(PA) registering a growth of 26 per cent over 2019-20 and 66.5 per cent in April 2021 over April \\n            2020.\\n            As we cautiously recuperate from the second wave, rapid vaccination and frontloading of the fiscal \\n            measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment, and thereby \\n            consumption, cycle in the coming quarters. As seen in Q4: FY 2020-21, where growth in capex \\n            generated positive spillovers for consumption, including in the contact-sensitive sectors, these steps \\n            would facilitate recovery post the second wave. Healthy monsoon forecasts bode well for continued \\n            momentum in agricultural growth. With state-level lockdown restrictions being more adaptive to \\n            learnings from the first wave, manufacturing and construction are expected to experience a softer \\n            economic shock in the current quarter. Quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination is critical to \\n            help India heal and regain the momentum of economic recovery.\\n            ******3\\n            India staged a V-shaped recovery in FY 2020-21\\n            1. As per the Provisional Estimates released by NSO, India’s GDP contracted at 7.3 per \\n            cent, which was an improvement over the Second Advance Estimate of a contraction of 8 per \\n            cent growth released in February 2021. This was largely due to the steady V-shaped recovery \\n            in India’s economy in the second half of FY: 2020-21. Monthly Economic Review, November \\n            2020, had stated that “This V-shaped recovery, evident at the half-way stage of 2020-21, \\n            reflects the resilience and robustness of the Indian economy”. This recovery is evident from \\n            the movement in various high-frequency indicators over the last year.\\n            2. The economy registered a YoY growth of 1.1 per cent in H2: FY 2020-21 as compared \\n            to (-) 15.9 per cent in H1: FY 2020-21 – implying a growth of 25.5 per cent in H2 over H1. In \\n            terms of Real GVA, the economy registered a contraction of 6.2 per cent in FY: 2020-21 with \\n            a contraction of 14.9 per cent in H1: FY 2020-21 and growth of 2.4 per cent in H2: FY 2020-\\n            21.

The growth in output in Q4 FY:2020-21 was broad-based across sectors. Agriculture, \\n            industry and services sector witnessed positive YoY growth during the quarter. The industrial \\n            sector grew at a 11-quarter high of 7.9 per cent aided by the higher output in manufacturing \\n            (6.9 per cent), electricity, gas, water & utility services (9.1 per cent) and construction (14.5 per \\n            cent). Only the mining and quarrying sector recorded negative growth during the quarter (-5.7 \\n            per cent). Agriculture sector grew by a strong 3.1 per cent in Q4 FY: 2020-21 which was over \\n            a high base of 6.8 per cent growth in the same period last year.

This improvement was led by finance, real estate & professional service (5.4 per cent \\n            growth) along with public administration (2.3 per cent growth). Contact-intensive hotels, trade \\n            and transport sectors contracted by only 2.3 per cent in Q4 after large declines in previous \\n            quarters.

Investments measured as Gross Fixed Capital \\n            Formation (GFCF) grew at a 7-quarter high of 10.9 per cent in Q4: FY 2020-21. With a strong \\n            policy focus on infrastructure spending and construction in latter half of FY 2020-21, Gross \\n            Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) to GDP ratio reached one of its highest at 34.3 per cent in \\n            over twenty-six quarters and construction rebounded to grow at 14.5 per cent in Q4. \\n            6.

Government Expenditure has served \\n            as the cushion for the year growing at a rate of 28.3 per cent in Q4 and 2.9 percent in the whole \\n            year. The onset of the second wave of COVID-19, however, has posed a downside risk to this \\n            momentum in India’s economic recovery. With the peaking of the second wave in first half of \\n            May 2021 and the localised restrictions adopted to combat its spread, its economic impact is \\n            expected to be restricted to the first quarter of FY: 2021-22. Taking all these factors into \\n            consideration, RBI has projected real GDP growth at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 18.5 \\n            per cent in Q1; 7.9 per cent in Q2; 7.2 per cent in Q3; and 6.6 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22.\\n            India past its Peak of Second wave – need to maintain the guard \\n            7.

India also attained the peak faster during the second \\n            wave - in 79 days compared to 220 days in first wave – signifying how swiftly the second wave \\n            enveloped the nation. Daily new cases have now trickled down from 4.1 lakh on 5th May 2021 \\n            to less than 1 lakh as on date. The daily positivity rate has dropped from a peak of 24.9 percent \\n            (on 9th May) to 4.6 percent as on date. The pace of spread has slowed down with increase in \\n            doubling time to 54 days in May from 46 days in April. The daily recoveries continue to \\n            outnumber daily new cases with recovery rate rising to 94.5 percent.

Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India \\n            for containment and management of the pandemic. The vaccination drive has been sequentially \\n            expanded to cover the prioritized groups starting with Health Care Workers (HCWs) followed \\n            by Front Line Workers (FLWs), then the persons aged 60 years and above and those aged 45-\\n            59 years with identified 20 co-morbidities. Subsequently, from 1st April 2021, all persons aged \\n            45 years and above were eligible for vaccination. Such an approach has yielded positive results \\n            by achieving more than 81 per cent 1st dose coverage amongst registered HCWs and around 84 \\n            per cent coverage of 1st dose amongst registered FLWs thereby protecting these cohorts who \\n            are involved in providing Health Care Services, Surveillance and Containment activities amidst \\n            the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. \\n            12. As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the 'Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated \\n            National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy' was implemented from 1st May 2021 wherein all \\n            above the age of 18 became eligible for vaccination. 50 per cent of the available doses were \\n            earmarked for supply to States/UTs, as free of cost supply from the Central Government, while \\n            25 per cent each was available for direct procurement from the vaccine manufacturers by \\n            States/UTs and private hospitals. To streamline the process further, it has now been decided \\n            that the 25 per cent vaccination that was with states will also now be undertaken by the Central \\n            Government and provided free of cost to the State Government for rolling out wef 21st June. \\n            25 per cent vaccines being procured directly by the private hospitals will continue with only \\n            ₹150 service charge is levied by the private hospitals over the decided price of the vaccines. \\n            13. India has crossed the 23.9 crore mark in its cumulative COVID vaccination coverage. \\n            Around 14 percent of beneficiaries receiving the first dose are healthcare and frontline workers, \\n            33 percent are senior citizens, 38 percent belong to 45 to 60 years age group and 15 percent \\n            beneficiaries are of the age group 18-44 years. An analysis of the state wise proportion of \\n            population vaccinated relative to its share in total population indicates that Bihar, Uttar \\n            Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand need to ramp up their \\n            vaccination drive. Vaccination remains the key guard against subsequent waves and the \\n            coverage of the population needs to be enhanced across all States. \\n            State wise share of vaccination relative to population share \\n            Source: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\n            AP\\n            AS\\n            BR\\n            CT\\n            DL\\n            GJ\\n            HR\\n            JK JH\\n            KA\\n            KL\\n            MP\\n            MH\\n            OR\\n            PB\\n            RJ\\n            TN\\n            TG\\n            UT\\n            WB\\n            0%\\n            2%\\n            4%\\n            6%\\n            8%\\n            10%\\n            12%\\n            0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12%\\n            State share in total vaccination \\n            State share in total population \\n            On right track, keep going\\n            Should vaccinate more \\n            UP (17%,9%)10\\n            14. Global research on high efficacy of first dose of vaccine, non-depletion of the impact \\n            of the first dose despite a longer gap1\\n            , reduction of both symptomatic and asymptomatic \\n            infections after the first dose2\\n            and higher benefits accruing from first-dose-vaccination of a \\n            larger population to render community protection can help design an effective inoculation \\n            strategy. Canada’s approach of prioritising ‘first dose for all’ has been a successful one with \\n            only 0.15 per cent of Canadians getting infected after getting vaccinated3\\n            . \\n            Need to achieve herd immunity at the earliest for economic recovery\\n            Herd immunity is accomplished when 80 percent of the population is immune or less \\n            susceptible to infection. The key to regain the momentum of economic recovery is attainment \\n            of herd immunity at the earliest possible. As per India’s demographic distribution, 86.5 crore \\n            people or 63.1 per cent of the population is above 18 years of age. Assuming herd immunity \\n            at 80 per cent, the target population to be vaccinated is 70 crore. As on date, 19.2 crore people \\n            have got the first dose while 4.7 crore have been fully vaccinated. If 70 crore people must be \\n            vaccinated by September 2021, it is estimated that around 113 crore doses are needed (19\\n            crore for the second dose + 47 crore for two doses). \\n            With around 120 days to 31st September 2021, around 93 lakh vaccinations are required per \\n            day to achieve the herd immunity. The peak daily vaccination rate attained till date is 42.65 \\n            lakh. This peak was achieved using one shift of 8-9 hours of vaccination. So, doubling the \\n            shifts and possibly vaccinating 24x7 for a couple of months – particularly in August and \\n            September when supply is expected to increase significantly – can enable the ambitious, but \\n            possible, throughput of 1 crore shots a day.\\n            The challenges of the ‘push’ factors of ensuring adequate and timely supplies for the target \\n            population size and efficient and equitable distribution of sourced vaccines; ‘pull’ factors of \\n            overcoming vaccine hesitancy and streamlining of ‘operational issues’ in administering the \\n            vaccine at scale with the right guidelines and technology as the enabler, are required to be \\n            handled upfront.\\n            Vaccine manufacturers have been ramping up capacity and over 216 crore of doses are \\n            estimated to be manufactured in India during August-December 2021. Attempts are being \\n            made to fast-track procurement efforts of vaccines from the international market. The supply \\n            can be aligned with the target of September 2021 with people already having antibodies \\n            vaccinated later while people who have not been exposed given priority. \\n            Communication efforts ought to be ramped up to minimise vaccination hesitancy especially \\n            in rural areas. Using the principles of behavioural economics via tailored messaging to spur \\n            vaccination demand, outreach campaigns to show how only vaccination can help India get \\n            out of the current crisis, mass mobilisation to address concerns around vaccination and \\n            improved ease of access to availability of vaccine can go a long way in ‘pulling’ vaccination \\n            demand.

Use of technology to ease the administration \\n            of the vaccine, increased shifts at vaccination centres and integration of mass vaccination \\n            sites e.g., shopping areas, drive-ins, with schools and primary health care centres will \\n            enhance faster coverage under vaccination.\\n            Expansion of vaccination to achieve herd immunity (75-80 per cent of the population) will \\n            boost consumer and producer confidence and reinvigorate the engines of economic growth. \\n            Vaccination of the target population (70 crore) with atleast the first dose till September 2021, \\n            therefore, becomes paramount and must be taken up on a mission mode.\\n            15. Globally, the increased coverage of population under vaccination has been effective \\n            both in controlling the spread of covid and boosting mobility. It was emphasized in the Monthly \\n            Economic Review, March 2021, that ‘Vaccines are a key macro lever for domestic and global \\n            economic growth’. The second wave enveloped India with its severity and swiftness of spread \\n            signifying that quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination is critical. With a focus to \\n            avoid or lower the ferocity of any subsequent third wave, an accelerated vaccination drive is \\n            imperative. \\n            Global Overview – mixed trends giving reasons to both cheer and fear\\n            16. The waning of the second wave in India mirrored the trend across the globe. In May, \\n            COVID-19 new cases declined both in advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and \\n            developing economies (EMDEs). Vaccination progress remains highly uneven and as of now, \\n            around 11 percent and 6 percent of total world’s population have been partially and fully \\n            inoculated respectively. Advanced economies have administered more than 36 doses per\\n            hundred people, compared to only 6 in EMDEs till May 2021. \\n            17. Global economic recovery accelerated further in May with European economies \\n            opening, vaccinations soaring, and US and China leading the recovery. Strong demand for \\n            goods and rebound in services, buttressed by fiscal support by few large economies and easy \\n            monetary conditions, have kept investors optimistic and eased job markets. That said, the \\n            divergence in recovery and vaccinations, with Latin America, Africa, and some Asian countries \\n            lagging behind threatens an across-the-board recovery. Moreover, continued rise in prices (both \\n            for producers and consumers) signal need to avert overheating of economies.\\n            18. Global PMI continued its broad-based rise in May and accelerated to 15-year high at \\n            58.4, as new orders and international trade rose at stronger rates. US and UK led output growth \\n            rankings and output prices rose at series-record pace, offsetting the subdued activity in Asia \\n            region. The rate of increase in services activity outpaced that of manufacturing production for \\n            the second month in May since the current revival in global activity began last July. UK PMI \\n            saw the fastest private sector growth since 1998, with pent-up demand and labour market easing \\n            with loosening of movement restrictions. Eurozone PMI rose to a 39-months high, to 56.9, as \\n            economies mobility restrictions and demand surged to fastest in 15 years. Japanese PMI \\n            returned to contractionary zone as resurge in COVID Cases and reimposition of restrictions led \\n            to deterioration in business conditions, the decline being led by contraction in services sector.12\\n            Global PMI Composite Indices Commodity Prices\\n            Source: IHS Markit; May numbers are Flash Estimates Source: IMF\\n            Commodity and Inflation\\n            19. Commodity prices rose further due to rising demand and supply chain disruptions, with \\n            increasing signs of high input costs being passed to consumers. The IMF All Commodities \\n            index grew by 71.6 per cent YoY in April, led by rise in crude oil and natural gas prices. On a \\n            sequential basis, all commodities rose by 2.2 per cent, crude oil prices declined by a slight 1.5 \\n            per cent, while natural gas rose by 14 per cent, backed by lower than average temperatures in \\n            Europe. World food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade to \\n            hit their highest level since September 2011. Gold prices started rising on back of weakening \\n            dollar and lowering yields. Base metals prices rose consecutively for the twelfth month, with \\n            global manufacturing activity steadily expanding, dollar weakening, and concerns over \\n            resurging COVID-19 cases in South America (affecting copper prices). Rise in consumer price \\n            inflation in major economies occurred with the background of recovery in advanced \\n            economies, commodity price rise, supply disruptions, and easy fiscal and monetary conditions, \\n            fuelling concerns of overheating and future increase in interest rates.

Global trade remained resilient, with global commercial flight activity moderating \\n            slightly in May remaining broadly stable, and port activity improving further into April. The \\n            average daily number of international commercial flights in May was 132 per cent of previous \\n            year level. Global port activity in April rose by 4 per cent MoM and 19 per cent YoY, led by \\n            upturn in Europe as lockdowns opened up. However, high freight rates and container shortages \\n            continue to be supply-side challenges. WTO’s Goods Trade Barometer also points to an \\n            acceleration in trade recovery in March 2021, with export orders, electronic components, and \\n            air freight booking major gains, as indicated by commercial flight and port activity numbers \\n            earlier. \\n            21. UNCTAD’s Global Trade Update, May 2021 underscores the resilience of international \\n            trade, recovering steadily after a steep fall in Q2 2020, further rebounding in Q1 of 2021. Trade \\n            has rebounded more quickly for developing countries compared to developed countries. \\n            However, East Asian economies strong export performance constitute a large chunk of this \\n            growth, driving much of the trade recovery for developing countries. Trade in goods surpassed \\n            its pre-pandemic levels in Q1 2021, however, trade in services remains below Q1 2019 levels. \\n            During Q1 2021, trade continued to rebound not only in sectors related to COVID-19 (e.g. \\n            pharmaceuticals, communication and office equipment) but also increased for most other \\n            sectors, such as minerals and agri-food. For 2021, global trade is projected to grow by 16 per \\n            cent, but the outlook remains uncertain in view of uneven economic recovery, COVID induced \\n            additional borrowings by government and private parties, trade policy developments, reshoring \\n            and nearshoring trends, among others. \\n            Financial markets \\n            22. Global financial conditions fluctuated in May and stabilised around the last week. This \\n            was mainly due to inflationary pressures in the US and surging commodity prices, stoking \\n            anxieties of upcoming rise in interest rates and bond yields. Advanced economies recorded \\n            modest gains at May end, as US job data uplifted investors’ spirit, with Dow Jones closing 2 \\n            per cent higher. Asian stocks, as measured with MSCI Asia Pacific Index, dipped around mid\\x02May, with inflationary pressures and resurgence in COVID-19 cases taking a toll on investor \\n            sentiment, wiping off the year’s gains so far.\\n            International Commercial Flights (Nos.)

Emerging as the silver lining among the pandemic-hit economy, agricultural sector has \\n            cushioned the economic impact being the only sector posting growth in FY 2020-21. India's \\n            foodgrain production is estimated to rise 2.7 per cent to a new record of 305.43 million tonnes \\n            in the current crop year 2020-21, on record output of rice, wheat, maize and gram. Total pulses \\n            production has also posted a record at 25.58 million tonnes – a rise of 11.2 per cent over last \\n            year. In the non-foodgrain category, based on record production of groundnut and Rapeseed & \\n            Mustard, total oilseeds production touched a record of 36.57 million tonnes – 10.1 per cent rise \\n            over last year. With the prediction of a ‘normal’ monsoons this year, the government has set a \\n            record target to raise foodgrain production further to 307.31 million tonnes during 2021-22 \\n            crop year, starting July. The south-west monsoon knocked on the doors of India by hitting the \\n            coast of Kerala on June 3. \\n            25. Public procurement of rice and wheat during the year 2020-21 has been going smoothly. \\n            Against the target to buy 427.4 LMT of wheat for the central pool during 2021, a record \\n            procurement of 411.12 LMT has already been done with Punjab accounting for 33 per cent of \\n            the same. All States, including Punjab and Haryana, have switched from the system of indirect \\n            payment of MSP to direct online transfers of benefit to farmers bank accounts against sale of \\n            their crops – enabling the proceeds of public procurement of foodgrains directly into the bank \\n            accounts of the farmers under “One Nation, One MSP, One DBT”.

The banking system saw a rise in precautionary demand for currency led by COVID\\x0219 pandemic induced uncertainty. Demand for Currency in circulation (CiC), which constitutes \\n            about 82 per cent of Reserve Money (RM), normally expands during the first fortnight owing \\n            to transactions by households, followed by contraction in the second fortnight due to flow back \\n            of currency from households to the banking system. However, the unusual rise in month-over\\x02month CiC variation during April-June 2020 compared to the corresponding period of previous \\n            years clearly signalled an uncertainty-driven surge in precautionary demand for cash during a \\n            crisis situation. Subsequently, with the continuous decline in COVID-19 cases from mid\\x02September to February 2021, relaxation of COVID-19 related restrictions and optimism \\n            surrounding vaccination, movements in CiC were primarily due to seasonal factors like \\n            agricultural sowing and harvesting, festivals, state elections, etc. In May 21, CiC increased by \\n            1.92 per cent over April 21 compared to an increase of 1.1 per cent during the same period in \\n            pre-COVID year FY 2019-20, reflecting increase in demand for cash. \\n            Reserve Money and its components\\n            Source: RBI\\n            Money supply growth bolstered by aggregate deposits, bank credit growth remains muted\\n            48. Broad money(M3) rose by 11.8 per cent in FY 2020-21 as compared to 8.7 per cent in \\n            FY 2019-20, driven by aggregate deposits (11.4 per cent YoY) and time deposits (10.9 per cent \\n            YoY) in particular, suggestive of depositor risk-aversion. Trends in demand deposits (15.1 per \\n            cent YoY) tracked changes in currency with the public with the latter rising by 17.8 per cent in \\n            the pandemic year of FY 2020-21 compared to 14 per cent in FY 2019-20. Owing to shifting \\n            preferences towards precautionary cash savings in the uncertain pandemic year, currency\\x02deposit ratio stood at 17.3 per cent in FY 2020-21 as compared to 16.3 per cent in FY 2019-20 \\n            and slightly above its decennial average (2011-20) of 15.2 per cent.

SCBs’ credit-deposit ratio declined\\n            to 72.4 per cent in FY 2020-21 compared to 76.4 per cent a year ago. Bank credit growth started \\n            picking pace gradually in the second half of the year as the economy unlocked and the RBI and \\n            Government led stimulus measures started demonstrating positive effects. Bank credit stood at \\n            5.6 per cent on a YoY basis for FY 2020-21 as compared with 6.1 per cent a year ago. While \\n            decline in credit growth in the year was broad-based on a sectoral basis, credit growth to \\n            agriculture (12.3 per cent), medium industries (28.8 per cent) and wholesale trade services \\n            (21.2 per cent) remained healthy. Credit to infrastructure also improved marginally (3.6 per \\n            cent) while personal loans growth remained in double digits (10.2 per cent). As on 21st May \\n            2021, bank credit growth stood at ₹108.34 lakh crore, declining by 0.3 per cent over the \\n            previous fortnight and growing at 6.0 per cent over the previous year. \\n            Bond yields softened across market segments and spreads narrowed\\n            Government Securities Market\\n            50. Tracking the continuum of unprecedented measures announced by RBI during FY \\n            2020-21 towards ensuring smooth monetary transmission, credit flows and fostering orderly \\n            market conditions, bond yields softened across market segments and spreads narrowed to pre\\x02COVID levels by end of January 2021. The benchmark 10-year yield, which had averaged 5.97 \\n            per cent from April 2020 to January 2021, surged to 6.22 per cent at end February 2021 and \\n            remained elevated at 6.13 per cent at end March 2021. This was driven by Central \\n            government’s announcement of additional borrowing of ₹80,000 crore for FY 2020-21 and \\n            elevated borrowing of ₹12.06 lakh crore for FY 2021-22. Additionally, increase in US Treasury \\n            yields and hardening of crude oil prices also contributed to the elevated bond yields. \\n            51. Introduction of the secondary market G-sec acquisition programme (G-SAP) in \\n            FY 2021-22 with an upfront commitment to a specific amount for open market purchases of \\n            G-secs exemplifies RBI’s continued efforts at ensuring a stable and orderly evolution of the \\n            yield curve under supportive financial conditions. Under G-SAP 1.0, RBI conducted the first \\n            tranche on 15 April 2021 in which it bought the entire notified amount of ₹25,000 crore. RBI \\n            conducted the second purchase for an aggregate amount of ₹35,000 crore on 20 May 2021. \\n            Enabled by G-SAP, India’s benchmark 10-year G-Sec yield eased to 5.99 per cent at end-May \\n            2021. RBI has announced another G-SAP 1.0 auction for purchase of G-Secs of ₹40,000 crore \\n            to be conducted on June 17, 2021 of which ₹10,000 crore would constitute purchase of state \\n            development loans (SDLs). Under G-SAP 2.0, secondary market purchase operations of ₹1.2 \\n            lakh crore will be conducted in Q2 of FY 2021-22. Apart from G-SAP, the RBI also introduced \\n            several regulatory measures to promote financial inclusion and enable payments banks to reach \\n            a wider subscriber base by enhancing the operational and liquidity limits allotted to them. \\n            Corporate bond market\\n            52. Triggered by COVID-19 outbreak, corporate bond yields stiffened in March-April 2020 \\n            with AAA rated 10-year bond yield reaching 7.3 per cent in April 2020. However, corporate \\n            bond yields significantly eased during FY 2020-21 to reach 6.7 per cent in January 2021 and \\n            closed at 7.1 per cent in March 2021. Movements in corporate bond markets largely mirrored \\n            G-sec market movements, reflecting the transmission of policy rate cuts to the corporate bond \\n            yields, surplus liquidity conditions and the effect of Government and RBI’s targeted measures. \\n            Tracking the movement in 10 year G-sec yield, 10 year AAA rated corporate bond yields too \\n            eased to reach 6.7 per cent in May 2021. The spread between corporate bond yields and 26\\n            corresponding G-sec yields also witnessed moderation across all periods of residual maturity. \\n            On the back of softening yields and easy financing conditions, primary corporate bond market \\n            issuances increased by 13.4 per cent to a record ₹7.8 lakh crore during FY 2020-21.

The Provisional Actuals (PA) data for the year 2020-21 released by the O/o of CGA \\n            highlights that the fiscal deficit for 2020-21 stood at ₹18.2 lakh crore which is 9.2 per cent of \\n            GDP – 0.3 points lower than estimated at RE stage. This lower Fiscal deficit is clearly due to \\n            buoyant revenue collections. The Net tax Revenue to the Centre showed an increase of 5.9 per \\n            cent in 2020-21 PA over RE. This was due to an improved collection observed under all the \\n            major tax revenue heads compared to the Revised estimates. Among the direct taxes, \\n            Corporation tax registered a growth of 2.5 per cent over RE and other taxes on income \\n            registered a growth of 5.9 per cent over RE. The improvement in indirect taxes (PA) over the \\n            Revised estimates, was also broad-based, as Customs, Excise duties and GST collections \\n            (Centre) turned out to be 120.3 per cent, 107.9 per cent and 106.5 per cent of RE respectively. \\n            Growth in fiscal indicators for 2020-21 (PA) over 2020-21 RE\\n            Source: CGA\\n            59.

Income tax collections for 2020-21 surpassed corporate tax collections by a \\n            marginal amount. The non-tax revenue also displayed a negative growth of 36.4 per cent in \\n            2020-21(PA) over 2019-20, largely led by dividends and profits which were 48 per cent lower \\n            than previous year. The disinvestment receipts during 2020-21(PA), which stood at nearly \\n            three-fourth of its corresponding collection during 2019-20, showed a marginal improvement \\n            of around ₹6000 crore over the target envisaged in the RE.\\n            60. On the expenditure side, the 2.5 per cent growth in revenue expenditure in 2020-21(PA) \\n            over the RE level, was largely driven by growth in expenditure on Food subsidy. The subsidy \\n            bill for the Centre went up by 202 per cent during 2020-21 PA over the previous year, on \\n            account of higher requirements of food and fertilizer subsidy due to the pandemic. Further, the \\n            emphasis on improving the quality of expenditure during the pandemic year can be seen as the \\n            capex in 2020-21(PA) registered a growth of 26 per cent over 2019-20 and reached 2.2 per cent \\n            of GDP. On comparing the accounts of 2020-21(PA) with 2019-20, it may be seen that the \\n            Fiscal deficit has doubled from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 9.2 per cent of GDP in 2020-\\n            21 PA. In terms of per cent of GDP, this entire increase in Fiscal deficit is equal to the increase \\n            in total expenditure in 2020-21(PA) over 2019-20. The higher expenditure requirements in FY \\n            2020-21 can be attributed towards various support/relief measures to mitigate the impact of \\n            pandemic and to the steps taken for enhancing the transparency in fiscal accounts.\\n            Fiscal indicators as a per cent of GDP\\n            Source: CGA\\n            61. During April 2021, the Centre’s fiscal deficit stood at ₹78,699 crore, which is 5.2 per \\n            cent of BE and is lower than 5 year -moving average of 29 per cent of BE. Both the tax and \\n            non-tax revenue collection during April 2021 was much higher than April 2020 due to \\n            resumption of economic activities, and a lower base effect. The Net Tax Revenue to the Centre \\n            stood at ₹1.3 lakh crore in April 2021, relative to ₹21,412 crore in April 2020. Moreover, on \\n            the expenditure side, the total expenditure in April 2021 contracted by 26 percent relative to \\n            April last year. However, the focus on capital expenditure continued as it registered a 66.5 per \\n            cent YoY growth during April 2021. This will be pivotal in bringing back the economy on a \\n            high growth trajectory, thereby facilitating buoyant revenues and a sustainable fiscal path in \\n            the medium term. \\n            4.6\\n            6.7\\n            1.6\\n            11.6\\n            1.60\\n            9.2\\n            7.2\\n            1.1\\n            15.6\\n            2.2\\n            0\\n            2\\n            4\\n            6\\n            8\\n            10\\n            12\\n            14\\n            16\\n            18\\n            Fiscal Deficit Net Tax Revenue NonTax Revenue Revenue\\n            Expenditure\\n            Capital Expenditure\\n            As a per cent of GDP\\n            2019-20 2020-21PA33\\n            India’s dynamic public debt management strategy enabled Central and State \\n            governments to meet their increasing financial needs\\n            62.

As per fourth quarterly GDP estimates released by NSO, it is clearly evident that growth \\n            recovered steadily in H2: FY 2020-21, on the back of higher government expenditure, revival \\n            in private consumption and investment in the fourth quarter. The service sector too re-entered \\n            the positive territory of growth in the fourth quarter. The onset of the second wave of COVID\\x0219 since mid-February 2021 and localized or state-wide restrictions adopted to combat its \\n            spread, have posed a probable downside risk to the momentum in India’s economic recovery \\n            in the first quarter of 2021-22. With state-level lockdown restrictions being more adaptive to \\n            learnings from the first wave, manufacturing and construction activities are expected to \\n            experience a softer economic shock in the current quarter. However, the speed and scale of the \\n            second wave has created some downside risk as economy was still recovering from last year’s \\n            supply and demand shocks.\\n            67. India’s COVID-19 second wave situation has been improving lately with a continuous \\n            decline in 7-day average of active cases since 13th May 2021. Data shows that the second wave \\n            reached its peak of 7-day average of daily new cases around 8th May, with the pace of decline \\n            being as fast as the rise. The daily case positivity rate has plummeted sharply from 24.9 per \\n            cent in early May to reach 3.6 per cent as on 2nd June 2021 – below the WHO standard of 5 \\n            per cent. Concomitantly, high frequency indicators in real and financial sectors like power \\n            consumption, E-way bills and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows witnessed slight uptick \\n            in the second half of May 2021 after enduring the second wave driven contraction during April \\n            and first half of May. \\n            68. Economic activity is inextricably linked to the path of the pandemic. The intensity of \\n            the second wave could not be predicted by epidemiologists, which lends uncertainty to the \\n            trajectory of the pandemic in the subsequent part of the year. The continuous upscaling of \\n            India’s vaccination drive, meticulous observation of COVID-appropriate behaviour and pro\\x02active application of India’s successful first-wave pandemic management policies raises hopes \\n            that the impact of the second wave on the economy may not be very large. As we cautiously \\n            recuperate from the second wave, rapidly improving vaccination delivery and frontloading the \\n            fiscal measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment cycle in \\n            the coming quarters. As seen in Q4: FY 2020-21, where growth in capex generated positive \\n            0\\n            1\\n            2\\n            3\\n            4\\n            5\\n            6\\n            7\\n            8\\n            9\\n            10\\n            2014-15\\n            2015-16\\n            2016-17\\n            2017-18\\n            2018-19\\n            2019-20\\n            2020-21\\n            (upto May 28)\\n            Rs. lakh crore\\n            Gross Net\\n            0\\n            1\\n            2\\n            3\\n            4\\n            5\\n            6\\n            7\\n            2014-15\\n            2015-16\\n            2016-17\\n            2017-18\\n            2018-19\\n            2019-20\\n            2020-21\\n            (upto May 28)\\n            Rs. lakh crore\\n            Gross Net35\\n            spillovers for consumption, including in the contact-sensitive sectors, these steps would \\n            facilitate recovery post the second wave. Healthy monsoon forecasts bode well for continued \\n            momentum in agricultural growth. \\n            69. A ramp up in the pace and spread of vaccination on a war footing is critical to help \\n            India restrain the impact of the pandemic. Continued vigilance in terms of pandemic \\n            preparedness, upscaling health spending and health infrastructure, faster rollout of vaccines \\n            and vaccination; investing in research and development to guard against possible mutants of \\n            the virus, prudent and pre-emptive restrictions, and strict observance of COVID-appropriate \\n            behaviour are essential to maintain the delicate balance of lives and livelihoods. \\n            ****\\n            For any queries, you may contact the team: \\n            1.

India’s real GDP is estimated to grow at 0.5 per cent in Q3 and 1.6 \\n            per cent in Q4 of FY 2020-21 leading to an upward revision in annual real GDP growth from (-)8.0 \\n            per cent (2nd Advance Estimates) to (-)7.3 per cent in FY 2020-21. Gross value added (GVA) at basic \\n            prices for FY 2020-21 is estimated to grow at (-)6.2 per cent with agriculture & allied activities lending \\n            its unwavering support for economic recovery throughout the year. Given the large contribution of \\n            subsidies in Q3 and Q4, estimated GVA growth of 1.6 per cent in Q3 and 3.7 per cent in Q4 is more \\n            representative of economic performance in the second half of FY 2020-21. India is one of the select few \\n            economies that have witnessed positive YoY growth in the last two consecutive quarters.\\n            With a strong policy focus on infrastructure spending and construction in latter half of FY 2020-21, the \\n            ratio of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) to GDP reached 34.3 per cent, among the highest in \\n            over twenty-six quarters. Also, construction rebounded to grow at 14.5 per cent in Q4. As economic \\n            activity resumed following gradual unlocking and policy support, private consumption grew at 2.7 per \\n            cent after falling for three consecutive quarters. Moreover, contact-intensive hotels, trade and transport \\n            sectors contracted by only 2.3 per cent in Q4 after large declines in previous quarters. \\n            This momentum of economic recovery has, however, been moderated by the ravaging second wave of \\n            COVID-19. Unlike the first wave, the effect of the second wave has been asynchronous in its onset \\n            across states and wider in its spread as the second wave also entered the rural hinterland. This \\n            necessitated a differentiated, state-level policy response in close coordination with the Central \\n            Government for rapid rebooting of health infrastructure and effective implementation of ‘Test, Track, \\n            Treat, Vaccinate and COVID-appropriate behaviour’. A continuous decline in the 7-day average of \\n            active cases since 13th May 2021 and the 7-day average of daily new cases after 8th May marked the \\n            declining phase of the second wave. \\n            Simultaneously, the world’s largest vaccination drive is underway in India with 23.9 crore doses \\n            administered as on date. To avoid or lower the ferocity of subsequent waves, an accelerated vaccination \\n            drive is imperative. Vaccinating to achieve herd immunity (75-80 per cent of the population) will boost \\n            consumer and producer confidence and reinvigorate the engines of economic growth. For this purpose, \\n            challenges pertaining to vaccine supply, vaccine hesitancy, operational aspects to achieve high daily \\n            throughput, and widespread reach must be anticipated and planned for in advance.\\n            After declining during the second wave. high frequency indicators such as power consumption, E-way \\n            bills and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows witnessed uptick in the second half of May 2021. \\n            Agriculture sector continues to offer comfortable prospects amidst a normal monsoon forecast, smooth \\n            food procurement and distribution, and MGNREGA employment. However, sequential slackening was \\n            observed in eight core industrial output, PMI manufacturing, steel consumption, auto sales, tractor \\n            sales, petroleum products consumption, rail freight, port and air traffic, PMI services, highway toll \\n            collections, GST collections and UPI transactions. \\n            CPI inflation eased to 4.3 per cent in April 2021 (as against 7.2 per cent in April 2020) from 5.5 per \\n            cent in March 2021 driven by decline in food inflation and a favorable base effect. Going forward, the \\n            trajectory for CPI inflation may derive comfort from the forecast of a normal south-west monsoon but\\n            remains vulnerable to pressures arising from high international commodity prices and logistics costs \\n            across manufacturing and services. WPI inflation, however, increased to 10.5 per cent in April 2021 as \\n            compared to 7.4 per cent in March 2021 on account of increase in inflation of all major groups, viz, \\n            Primary articles, Fuel & power and Manufactured products and base effect.2\\n            On the external front, exports grew at 7.9 per cent in May 2021 over pre-COVID May 2019 levels, \\n            thereby reflecting export resilience amidst global economic recovery. However, domestic demand \\n            prospects remained tentative with imports declining by 17.5 per cent. India emerged as the preferred \\n            investment destination, attracting highest ever FDI inflow of USD 81.7 billion during the pandemic \\n            year FY 2020-21, particularly in computer software & hardware and infrastructure sectors. Bolstered \\n            by resurgent net foreign inflows, easing of the second wave and weakening dollar, the Indian Rupee \\n            made a strong comeback in May 2021 to reach INR/USD 72.8 and became the best performing Asian \\n            currency in the month. \\n            On the monetary side, money supply continued to rise by 9.9 per cent (YoY) as on 21st May 2021 driven \\n            by growth in aggregate deposits. Monthly growth in currency-in-circulation (CiC) which had begun to \\n            moderate in the second half of FY 20-21 picked up again in April and May 2021, suggestive of rise in \\n            precautionary demand for cash during the second wave, albeit lower than first wave levels. Bank credit \\n            YoY growth continued to remain muted at 6.0 per cent as on 21st May 2021. Growth of non-food credit \\n            at over 12.4 per cent over the corresponding period in FY 2019-20 is noteworthy given the policy\\x02driven focus on private investment. \\n            Financial conditions in May 2021 have remained conducive for economic recovery with systemic \\n            liquidity in surplus, continued accommodative monetary policy stance – as outlined in June 4 Monetary \\n            Policy statement - and unhindered efforts towards smooth policy transmission. To mitigate challenges \\n            of the second wave, RBI has further unveiled developmental and regulatory measures to ensure \\n            equitable liquidity support for affected sectors and financial stability. \\n            India’s dynamic public debt management strategy and RBI’s artillery of conventional and \\n            unconventional instruments like G-SAP 1.0 has enabled Central and State governments to meet their \\n            increasing financial needs amid the pandemic at low costs of borrowing and manageable levels of risk. \\n            The 10-year G-Sec yield stayed below 6 per cent despite the uncertainty engendered by the second wave. \\n            Corporate bond yields largely tracked G-sec market movements, reflecting policy rate transmission to \\n            corporate bond market and surplus liquidity conditions. Primary corporate bond market issuances \\n            increased by 13.4 per cent to a record Rs. 7.8 lakh crore during FY 2020-21. \\n            Driven by buoyant and broad-based growth in Centre's net revenue collections of 5.9 per cent for 2020-\\n            21 Provisional Actuals (PA) over 2020-21 Revised Estimates (RE) and nearly 5 per cent growth over \\n            2019-20, Centre's fiscal deficit for FY 2020-21 stood at 9.2 per cent of GDP for 2020-21 (PA), 0.3 \\n            percentage points lower than RE. Quality of expenditure crucially improved with capex in FY 2020-\\n            21(PA) registering a growth of 26 per cent over 2019-20 and 66.5 per cent in April 2021 over April \\n            2020.\\n            As we cautiously recuperate from the second wave, rapid vaccination and frontloading of the fiscal \\n            measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment, and thereby \\n            consumption, cycle in the coming quarters. As seen in Q4: FY 2020-21, where growth in capex \\n            generated positive spillovers for consumption, including in the contact-sensitive sectors, these steps \\n            would facilitate recovery post the second wave. Healthy monsoon forecasts bode well for continued \\n            momentum in agricultural growth. With state-level lockdown restrictions being more adaptive to \\n            learnings from the first wave, manufacturing and construction are expected to experience a softer \\n            economic shock in the current quarter. Quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination is critical to \\n            help India heal and regain the momentum of economic recovery.\\n            ******3\\n            India staged a V-shaped recovery in FY 2020-21\\n            1. As per the Provisional Estimates released by NSO, India’s GDP contracted at 7.3 per \\n            cent, which was an improvement over the Second Advance Estimate of a contraction of 8 per \\n            cent growth released in February 2021. This was largely due to the steady V-shaped recovery \\n            in India’s economy in the second half of FY: 2020-21. Monthly Economic Review, November \\n            2020, had stated that “This V-shaped recovery, evident at the half-way stage of 2020-21, \\n            reflects the resilience and robustness of the Indian economy”. This recovery is evident from \\n            the movement in various high-frequency indicators over the last year.\\n            2. The economy registered a YoY growth of 1.1 per cent in H2: FY 2020-21 as compared \\n            to (-) 15.9 per cent in H1: FY 2020-21 – implying a growth of 25.5 per cent in H2 over H1. In \\n            terms of Real GVA, the economy registered a contraction of 6.2 per cent in FY: 2020-21 with \\n            a contraction of 14.9 per cent in H1: FY 2020-21 and growth of 2.4 per cent in H2: FY 2020-\\n            21. The divergence in GDP and GVA growth in FY: 2020-21 reflects a sharp fall of 18.4 per \\n            cent in net taxes that can be attributed to adjustment of food subsidy arrears in the last quarter \\n            of the fiscal.\\n            India’s GDP Growth: V-shaped recovery\\n            Source: MOSPI\\n            V-shaped Recovery also evident in movement of high frequency indicators\\n            Source: Compiled from various sources\\n            -30%\\n            -25%\\n            -20%\\n            -15%\\n            -10%\\n            -5%\\n            0%\\n            5%\\n            10%\\n            0\\n            5\\n            10\\n            15\\n            20\\n            25\\n            30\\n            35\\n            Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\\n            2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21\\n            Rs. lakh crore\\n            GDP YoY growth (RHS)\\n            0\\n            10\\n            20\\n            30\\n            40\\n            50\\n            60\\n            70\\n            0\\n            40\\n            80\\n            120\\n            160\\n            200\\n            Apr 19\\n            May 19\\n            Jun 19\\n            Jul 19\\n            Aug 19\\n            Sep 19\\n            Oct 19\\n            Nov 19\\n            Dec 19\\n            Jan 20\\n            Feb 20\\n            Mar 20\\n            Apr 20\\n            May 20\\n            Jun 20\\n            Jul 20\\n            Aug 20\\n            Sep 20\\n            Oct 20\\n            Nov 20\\n            Dec 20\\n            Jan 21\\n            Feb 21\\n            Mar 21\\n            Apr 21\\n            GST collection (Rs lakh crore) IIP Index\\n            Power consumption ('000 Mega Units) Petroleum Products Consumption ('000 tonnes)\\n            PMI Manufacturing (RHS) PMI Services (RHS)\\n            Merchandise Imports (USD billion) (RHS)4\\n            3.

In terms of GVA, the economy grew at 3.7 per \\n            cent in Q4: FY 2020-21, an improvement over the 1.0 per cent growth in Q3: FY 2020-21 and \\n            the negative growth of 22.4 per cent and 7.3 per cent in the first two quarters of FY 2020-Given \\n            the large contribution of subsidies in Q3 and Q4, estimated GVA growth of 1.6 per cent in Q3 \\n            and 3.7 per cent in Q4 is more representative of economic performance in the second half of \\n            FY 2020-21. The higher economic growth during the fourth quarter can be linked to the \\n            unlocking of the economy and revival in business and consumer confidence that was underway \\n            during the period.

The industrial \\n            sector grew at a 11-quarter high of 7.9 per cent aided by the higher output in manufacturing \\n            (6.9 per cent), electricity, gas, water & utility services (9.1 per cent) and construction (14.5 per \\n            cent). Only the mining and quarrying sector recorded negative growth during the quarter (-5.7 \\n            per cent). Agriculture sector grew by a strong 3.1 per cent in Q4 FY: 2020-21 which was over \\n            a high base of 6.8 per cent growth in the same period last year. The services sector returned to \\n            growth after a gap of three quarters in Q4 FY: 2020-21, recording a YoY growth of 1.5 per \\n            cent. This improvement was led by finance, real estate & professional service (5.4 per cent \\n            growth) along with public administration (2.3 per cent growth). Contact-intensive hotels, trade \\n            and transport sectors contracted by only 2.3 per cent in Q4 after large declines in previous \\n            quarters. Agriculture was the only sector which registered growth in FY: 2020-21 raising its \\n            share in overall GVA.5\\n            5. There has been a notable pick- up in investment and consumption (both government \\n            and private consumption) in Q4: FY 2020-21 when compared with the preceding three quarters. \\n            Private consumption which is the main driver of the economy (accounting for 60 per cent of \\n            the GDP) witnessed a YoY growth of 2.7 per cent in Q4: FY 2020-21 as compared to (-)26.2 \\n            per cent in Q1, (-)11.2 per cent in Q2 and (-)2.8 per cent in Q3: FY 2020-21. Government \\n            consumption witnessed a sharp increase, growing by 28.3 per cent in Q4: FY 2020-21 over the \\n            12.1 per cent growth in Q4: FY 2019-20. Investments measured as Gross Fixed Capital \\n            Formation (GFCF) grew at a 7-quarter high of 10.9 per cent in Q4: FY 2020-21. With a strong \\n            policy focus on infrastructure spending and construction in latter half of FY 2020-21, Gross \\n            Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) to GDP ratio reached one of its highest at 34.3 per cent in \\n            over twenty-six quarters and construction rebounded to grow at 14.5 per cent in Q4. \\n            6. The GDP estimates for the year 2020-21 corroborate that the Indian economy was \\n            steadily recovering in the second half of the year.

Government Expenditure has served \\n            as the cushion for the year growing at a rate of 28.3 per cent in Q4 and 2.9 percent in the whole \\n            year. The onset of the second wave of COVID-19, however, has posed a downside risk to this \\n            momentum in India’s economic recovery. With the peaking of the second wave in first half of \\n            May 2021 and the localised restrictions adopted to combat its spread, its economic impact is \\n            expected to be restricted to the first quarter of FY: 2021-22. Taking all these factors into \\n            consideration, RBI has projected real GDP growth at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 18.5 \\n            per cent in Q1; 7.9 per cent in Q2; 7.2 per cent in Q3; and 6.6 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22.\\n            India past its Peak of Second wave – need to maintain the guard \\n            7. In India, the pace of contagion in the second wave has been alarming, stretching the \\n            health infrastructure in terms of the capacity to handle a surge of this size and speed. A decline \\n            in seven days moving average of new cases since 8th May 2021 and seven days moving average \\n            of active cases since 13th May 2021 marked the attainment of the peak of the second wave –\\n            almost 4 times the peak in the first wave. India also attained the peak faster during the second \\n            wave - in 79 days compared to 220 days in first wave – signifying how swiftly the second wave \\n            enveloped the nation. Daily new cases have now trickled down from 4.1 lakh on 5th May 2021 \\n            to less than 1 lakh as on date. The daily positivity rate has dropped from a peak of 24.9 percent \\n            (on 9th May) to 4.6 percent as on date. The pace of spread has slowed down with increase in \\n            doubling time to 54 days in May from 46 days in April. The daily recoveries continue to \\n            outnumber daily new cases with recovery rate rising to 94.5 percent. As on date, India has 12.3\\n            lakh active cases – down from a peak of 37.3 lakh cases on 13th May 2021 with cumulative \\n            fatality rate at 1.2 percent. \\n            Daily Cases and Positivity Rate Doubling Time (in Days)\\n            Source: https://www.covid19india.org/\\n            Note: Doubling rate defined as ln2/ ln (1 + r), where r is average of last 30 days of growth in cumulative cases\\n            Note: Doubling rate is defined as ln2/ ln (1 + r), where r is the average of last seven days of \\n            growth in cumulative cases.\\n            8.

The number of rural districts bearing 20 percent of new cases increased \\n            sharply from 12 in March to 43 districts in April that rose further to 47 in May, which in turn \\n            is 3.4 times greater than their share during the peak of the first wave.8\\n            Share in new cases Number of rural districts with share of 20 \\n            percent in new cases\\n            Source: https://www.covid19india.org/\\n            Note: Rural districts are classified using 2011 census data and defined as male population (75% and above) \\n            engaged in non-agriculture activities and have population density of 400 persons per sq.km.\\n            10.

Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India \\n            for containment and management of the pandemic. The vaccination drive has been sequentially \\n            expanded to cover the prioritized groups starting with Health Care Workers (HCWs) followed \\n            by Front Line Workers (FLWs), then the persons aged 60 years and above and those aged 45-\\n            59 years with identified 20 co-morbidities. Subsequently, from 1st April 2021, all persons aged \\n            45 years and above were eligible for vaccination. Such an approach has yielded positive results \\n            by achieving more than 81 per cent 1st dose coverage amongst registered HCWs and around 84 \\n            per cent coverage of 1st dose amongst registered FLWs thereby protecting these cohorts who \\n            are involved in providing Health Care Services, Surveillance and Containment activities amidst \\n            the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. \\n            12. As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the 'Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated \\n            National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy' was implemented from 1st May 2021 wherein all \\n            above the age of 18 became eligible for vaccination. 50 per cent of the available doses were \\n            earmarked for supply to States/UTs, as free of cost supply from the Central Government, while \\n            25 per cent each was available for direct procurement from the vaccine manufacturers by \\n            States/UTs and private hospitals. To streamline the process further, it has now been decided \\n            that the 25 per cent vaccination that was with states will also now be undertaken by the Central \\n            Government and provided free of cost to the State Government for rolling out wef 21st June. \\n            25 per cent vaccines being procured directly by the private hospitals will continue with only \\n            ₹150 service charge is levied by the private hospitals over the decided price of the vaccines. \\n            13. India has crossed the 23.9 crore mark in its cumulative COVID vaccination coverage. \\n            Around 14 percent of beneficiaries receiving the first dose are healthcare and frontline workers, \\n            33 percent are senior citizens, 38 percent belong to 45 to 60 years age group and 15 percent \\n            beneficiaries are of the age group 18-44 years. An analysis of the state wise proportion of \\n            population vaccinated relative to its share in total population indicates that Bihar, Uttar \\n            Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand need to ramp up their \\n            vaccination drive. Vaccination remains the key guard against subsequent waves and the \\n            coverage of the population needs to be enhanced across all States. \\n            State wise share of vaccination relative to population share \\n            Source: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\n            AP\\n            AS\\n            BR\\n            CT\\n            DL\\n            GJ\\n            HR\\n            JK JH\\n            KA\\n            KL\\n            MP\\n            MH\\n            OR\\n            PB\\n            RJ\\n            TN\\n            TG\\n            UT\\n            WB\\n            0%\\n            2%\\n            4%\\n            6%\\n            8%\\n            10%\\n            12%\\n            0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12%\\n            State share in total vaccination \\n            State share in total population \\n            On right track, keep going\\n            Should vaccinate more \\n            UP (17%,9%)10\\n            14. Global research on high efficacy of first dose of vaccine, non-depletion of the impact \\n            of the first dose despite a longer gap1\\n            , reduction of both symptomatic and asymptomatic \\n            infections after the first dose2\\n            and higher benefits accruing from first-dose-vaccination of a \\n            larger population to render community protection can help design an effective inoculation \\n            strategy. Canada’s approach of prioritising ‘first dose for all’ has been a successful one with \\n            only 0.15 per cent of Canadians getting infected after getting vaccinated3\\n            . \\n            Need to achieve herd immunity at the earliest for economic recovery\\n            Herd immunity is accomplished when 80 percent of the population is immune or less \\n            susceptible to infection. The key to regain the momentum of economic recovery is attainment \\n            of herd immunity at the earliest possible. As per India’s demographic distribution, 86.5 crore \\n            people or 63.1 per cent of the population is above 18 years of age. Assuming herd immunity \\n            at 80 per cent, the target population to be vaccinated is 70 crore. As on date, 19.2 crore people \\n            have got the first dose while 4.7 crore have been fully vaccinated. If 70 crore people must be \\n            vaccinated by September 2021, it is estimated that around 113 crore doses are needed (19\\n            crore for the second dose + 47 crore for two doses). \\n            With around 120 days to 31st September 2021, around 93 lakh vaccinations are required per \\n            day to achieve the herd immunity. The peak daily vaccination rate attained till date is 42.65 \\n            lakh. This peak was achieved using one shift of 8-9 hours of vaccination. So, doubling the \\n            shifts and possibly vaccinating 24x7 for a couple of months – particularly in August and \\n            September when supply is expected to increase significantly – can enable the ambitious, but \\n            possible, throughput of 1 crore shots a day.\\n            The challenges of the ‘push’ factors of ensuring adequate and timely supplies for the target \\n            population size and efficient and equitable distribution of sourced vaccines; ‘pull’ factors of \\n            overcoming vaccine hesitancy and streamlining of ‘operational issues’ in administering the \\n            vaccine at scale with the right guidelines and technology as the enabler, are required to be \\n            handled upfront.\\n            Vaccine manufacturers have been ramping up capacity and over 216 crore of doses are \\n            estimated to be manufactured in India during August-December 2021. Attempts are being \\n            made to fast-track procurement efforts of vaccines from the international market. The supply \\n            can be aligned with the target of September 2021 with people already having antibodies \\n            vaccinated later while people who have not been exposed given priority. \\n            Communication efforts ought to be ramped up to minimise vaccination hesitancy especially \\n            in rural areas. Using the principles of behavioural economics via tailored messaging to spur \\n            vaccination demand, outreach campaigns to show how only vaccination can help India get \\n            out of the current crisis, mass mobilisation to address concerns around vaccination and \\n            improved ease of access to availability of vaccine can go a long way in ‘pulling’ vaccination \\n            demand.

Use of technology to ease the administration \\n            of the vaccine, increased shifts at vaccination centres and integration of mass vaccination \\n            sites e.g., shopping areas, drive-ins, with schools and primary health care centres will \\n            enhance faster coverage under vaccination.\\n            Expansion of vaccination to achieve herd immunity (75-80 per cent of the population) will \\n            boost consumer and producer confidence and reinvigorate the engines of economic growth. \\n            Vaccination of the target population (70 crore) with atleast the first dose till September 2021, \\n            therefore, becomes paramount and must be taken up on a mission mode.\\n            15. Globally, the increased coverage of population under vaccination has been effective \\n            both in controlling the spread of covid and boosting mobility. It was emphasized in the Monthly \\n            Economic Review, March 2021, that ‘Vaccines are a key macro lever for domestic and global \\n            economic growth’. The second wave enveloped India with its severity and swiftness of spread \\n            signifying that quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination is critical. With a focus to \\n            avoid or lower the ferocity of any subsequent third wave, an accelerated vaccination drive is \\n            imperative. \\n            Global Overview – mixed trends giving reasons to both cheer and fear\\n            16. The waning of the second wave in India mirrored the trend across the globe. In May, \\n            COVID-19 new cases declined both in advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and \\n            developing economies (EMDEs). Vaccination progress remains highly uneven and as of now, \\n            around 11 percent and 6 percent of total world’s population have been partially and fully \\n            inoculated respectively. Advanced economies have administered more than 36 doses per\\n            hundred people, compared to only 6 in EMDEs till May 2021. \\n            17. Global economic recovery accelerated further in May with European economies \\n            opening, vaccinations soaring, and US and China leading the recovery. Strong demand for \\n            goods and rebound in services, buttressed by fiscal support by few large economies and easy \\n            monetary conditions, have kept investors optimistic and eased job markets. That said, the \\n            divergence in recovery and vaccinations, with Latin America, Africa, and some Asian countries \\n            lagging behind threatens an across-the-board recovery. Moreover, continued rise in prices (both \\n            for producers and consumers) signal need to avert overheating of economies.\\n            18. Global PMI continued its broad-based rise in May and accelerated to 15-year high at \\n            58.4, as new orders and international trade rose at stronger rates. US and UK led output growth \\n            rankings and output prices rose at series-record pace, offsetting the subdued activity in Asia \\n            region. The rate of increase in services activity outpaced that of manufacturing production for \\n            the second month in May since the current revival in global activity began last July. UK PMI \\n            saw the fastest private sector growth since 1998, with pent-up demand and labour market easing \\n            with loosening of movement restrictions. Eurozone PMI rose to a 39-months high, to 56.9, as \\n            economies mobility restrictions and demand surged to fastest in 15 years. Japanese PMI \\n            returned to contractionary zone as resurge in COVID Cases and reimposition of restrictions led \\n            to deterioration in business conditions, the decline being led by contraction in services sector.12\\n            Global PMI Composite Indices Commodity Prices\\n            Source: IHS Markit; May numbers are Flash Estimates Source: IMF\\n            Commodity and Inflation\\n            19. Commodity prices rose further due to rising demand and supply chain disruptions, with \\n            increasing signs of high input costs being passed to consumers. The IMF All Commodities \\n            index grew by 71.6 per cent YoY in April, led by rise in crude oil and natural gas prices. On a \\n            sequential basis, all commodities rose by 2.2 per cent, crude oil prices declined by a slight 1.5 \\n            per cent, while natural gas rose by 14 per cent, backed by lower than average temperatures in \\n            Europe. World food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade to \\n            hit their highest level since September 2011. Gold prices started rising on back of weakening \\n            dollar and lowering yields. Base metals prices rose consecutively for the twelfth month, with \\n            global manufacturing activity steadily expanding, dollar weakening, and concerns over \\n            resurging COVID-19 cases in South America (affecting copper prices). Rise in consumer price \\n            inflation in major economies occurred with the background of recovery in advanced \\n            economies, commodity price rise, supply disruptions, and easy fiscal and monetary conditions, \\n            fuelling concerns of overheating and future increase in interest rates.

Global trade remained resilient, with global commercial flight activity moderating \\n            slightly in May remaining broadly stable, and port activity improving further into April. The \\n            average daily number of international commercial flights in May was 132 per cent of previous \\n            year level. Global port activity in April rose by 4 per cent MoM and 19 per cent YoY, led by \\n            upturn in Europe as lockdowns opened up. However, high freight rates and container shortages \\n            continue to be supply-side challenges. WTO’s Goods Trade Barometer also points to an \\n            acceleration in trade recovery in March 2021, with export orders, electronic components, and \\n            air freight booking major gains, as indicated by commercial flight and port activity numbers \\n            earlier. \\n            21. UNCTAD’s Global Trade Update, May 2021 underscores the resilience of international \\n            trade, recovering steadily after a steep fall in Q2 2020, further rebounding in Q1 of 2021. Trade \\n            has rebounded more quickly for developing countries compared to developed countries. \\n            However, East Asian economies strong export performance constitute a large chunk of this \\n            growth, driving much of the trade recovery for developing countries. Trade in goods surpassed \\n            its pre-pandemic levels in Q1 2021, however, trade in services remains below Q1 2019 levels. \\n            During Q1 2021, trade continued to rebound not only in sectors related to COVID-19 (e.g. \\n            pharmaceuticals, communication and office equipment) but also increased for most other \\n            sectors, such as minerals and agri-food. For 2021, global trade is projected to grow by 16 per \\n            cent, but the outlook remains uncertain in view of uneven economic recovery, COVID induced \\n            additional borrowings by government and private parties, trade policy developments, reshoring \\n            and nearshoring trends, among others. \\n            Financial markets \\n            22. Global financial conditions fluctuated in May and stabilised around the last week. This \\n            was mainly due to inflationary pressures in the US and surging commodity prices, stoking \\n            anxieties of upcoming rise in interest rates and bond yields.

Since the adoption of a new liquidity management framework by RBI in February 2020 \\n            with requirement based interventions and no fixed daily liquidity injection operations, the \\n            weighted average call rate (WACR) has remained the operating target of monetary policy with \\n            RBI’s efforts aimed at providing adequate liquidity to anchor the call rate at around the repo \\n            rate. After remaining within the policy corridor till mid-October 2020, WACR slipped below \\n            the reverse repo rate of 3.35 per cent, reflecting surplus liquidity conditions. The average spread \\n            of the WACR over the policy repo rate increased to (-)63 bps in 2020-21 from (-)9 bps in 2019-\\n            20. During April and May 2021, WACR traded below the reverse repo rate by 22 bps on \\n            average. Among other key money market instruments, interest rates on 3 month T-Bills, \\n            certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial papers (CPs) generally softened on account of \\n            surplus liquidity during 2020-21. In May 2021, the 3-month T-bill rate and 3-month CD rate \\n            traded below or close to the reverse repo rate, while the interest rate on 3-month CP rates inched \\n            above the reverse repo rate.\\n            42.

The banking system saw a rise in precautionary demand for currency led by COVID\\x0219 pandemic induced uncertainty. Demand for Currency in circulation (CiC), which constitutes \\n            about 82 per cent of Reserve Money (RM), normally expands during the first fortnight owing \\n            to transactions by households, followed by contraction in the second fortnight due to flow back \\n            of currency from households to the banking system. However, the unusual rise in month-over\\x02month CiC variation during April-June 2020 compared to the corresponding period of previous \\n            years clearly signalled an uncertainty-driven surge in precautionary demand for cash during a \\n            crisis situation. Subsequently, with the continuous decline in COVID-19 cases from mid\\x02September to February 2021, relaxation of COVID-19 related restrictions and optimism \\n            surrounding vaccination, movements in CiC were primarily due to seasonal factors like \\n            agricultural sowing and harvesting, festivals, state elections, etc. In May 21, CiC increased by \\n            1.92 per cent over April 21 compared to an increase of 1.1 per cent during the same period in \\n            pre-COVID year FY 2019-20, reflecting increase in demand for cash. \\n            Reserve Money and its components\\n            Source: RBI\\n            Money supply growth bolstered by aggregate deposits, bank credit growth remains muted\\n            48.

Tracking the continuum of unprecedented measures announced by RBI during FY \\n            2020-21 towards ensuring smooth monetary transmission, credit flows and fostering orderly \\n            market conditions, bond yields softened across market segments and spreads narrowed to pre\\x02COVID levels by end of January 2021. The benchmark 10-year yield, which had averaged 5.97 \\n            per cent from April 2020 to January 2021, surged to 6.22 per cent at end February 2021 and \\n            remained elevated at 6.13 per cent at end March 2021. This was driven by Central \\n            government’s announcement of additional borrowing of ₹80,000 crore for FY 2020-21 and \\n            elevated borrowing of ₹12.06 lakh crore for FY 2021-22. Additionally, increase in US Treasury \\n            yields and hardening of crude oil prices also contributed to the elevated bond yields. \\n            51. Introduction of the secondary market G-sec acquisition programme (G-SAP) in \\n            FY 2021-22 with an upfront commitment to a specific amount for open market purchases of \\n            G-secs exemplifies RBI’s continued efforts at ensuring a stable and orderly evolution of the \\n            yield curve under supportive financial conditions. Under G-SAP 1.0, RBI conducted the first \\n            tranche on 15 April 2021 in which it bought the entire notified amount of ₹25,000 crore. RBI \\n            conducted the second purchase for an aggregate amount of ₹35,000 crore on 20 May 2021. \\n            Enabled by G-SAP, India’s benchmark 10-year G-Sec yield eased to 5.99 per cent at end-May \\n            2021. RBI has announced another G-SAP 1.0 auction for purchase of G-Secs of ₹40,000 crore \\n            to be conducted on June 17, 2021 of which ₹10,000 crore would constitute purchase of state \\n            development loans (SDLs). Under G-SAP 2.0, secondary market purchase operations of ₹1.2 \\n            lakh crore will be conducted in Q2 of FY 2021-22. Apart from G-SAP, the RBI also introduced \\n            several regulatory measures to promote financial inclusion and enable payments banks to reach \\n            a wider subscriber base by enhancing the operational and liquidity limits allotted to them. \\n            Corporate bond market\\n            52. Triggered by COVID-19 outbreak, corporate bond yields stiffened in March-April 2020 \\n            with AAA rated 10-year bond yield reaching 7.3 per cent in April 2020. However, corporate \\n            bond yields significantly eased during FY 2020-21 to reach 6.7 per cent in January 2021 and \\n            closed at 7.1 per cent in March 2021. Movements in corporate bond markets largely mirrored \\n            G-sec market movements, reflecting the transmission of policy rate cuts to the corporate bond \\n            yields, surplus liquidity conditions and the effect of Government and RBI’s targeted measures. \\n            Tracking the movement in 10 year G-sec yield, 10 year AAA rated corporate bond yields too \\n            eased to reach 6.7 per cent in May 2021. The spread between corporate bond yields and 26\\n            corresponding G-sec yields also witnessed moderation across all periods of residual maturity. \\n            On the back of softening yields and easy financing conditions, primary corporate bond market \\n            issuances increased by 13.4 per cent to a record ₹7.8 lakh crore during FY 2020-21.

The Provisional Actuals (PA) data for the year 2020-21 released by the O/o of CGA \\n            highlights that the fiscal deficit for 2020-21 stood at ₹18.2 lakh crore which is 9.2 per cent of \\n            GDP – 0.3 points lower than estimated at RE stage. This lower Fiscal deficit is clearly due to \\n            buoyant revenue collections. The Net tax Revenue to the Centre showed an increase of 5.9 per \\n            cent in 2020-21 PA over RE. This was due to an improved collection observed under all the \\n            major tax revenue heads compared to the Revised estimates. Among the direct taxes, \\n            Corporation tax registered a growth of 2.5 per cent over RE and other taxes on income \\n            registered a growth of 5.9 per cent over RE. The improvement in indirect taxes (PA) over the \\n            Revised estimates, was also broad-based, as Customs, Excise duties and GST collections \\n            (Centre) turned out to be 120.3 per cent, 107.9 per cent and 106.5 per cent of RE respectively. \\n            Growth in fiscal indicators for 2020-21 (PA) over 2020-21 RE\\n            Source: CGA\\n            59.

Income tax collections for 2020-21 surpassed corporate tax collections by a \\n            marginal amount. The non-tax revenue also displayed a negative growth of 36.4 per cent in \\n            2020-21(PA) over 2019-20, largely led by dividends and profits which were 48 per cent lower \\n            than previous year. The disinvestment receipts during 2020-21(PA), which stood at nearly \\n            three-fourth of its corresponding collection during 2019-20, showed a marginal improvement \\n            of around ₹6000 crore over the target envisaged in the RE.\\n            60. On the expenditure side, the 2.5 per cent growth in revenue expenditure in 2020-21(PA) \\n            over the RE level, was largely driven by growth in expenditure on Food subsidy. The subsidy \\n            bill for the Centre went up by 202 per cent during 2020-21 PA over the previous year, on \\n            account of higher requirements of food and fertilizer subsidy due to the pandemic. Further, the \\n            emphasis on improving the quality of expenditure during the pandemic year can be seen as the \\n            capex in 2020-21(PA) registered a growth of 26 per cent over 2019-20 and reached 2.2 per cent \\n            of GDP. On comparing the accounts of 2020-21(PA) with 2019-20, it may be seen that the \\n            Fiscal deficit has doubled from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 9.2 per cent of GDP in 2020-\\n            21 PA. In terms of per cent of GDP, this entire increase in Fiscal deficit is equal to the increase \\n            in total expenditure in 2020-21(PA) over 2019-20. The higher expenditure requirements in FY \\n            2020-21 can be attributed towards various support/relief measures to mitigate the impact of \\n            pandemic and to the steps taken for enhancing the transparency in fiscal accounts.\\n            Fiscal indicators as a per cent of GDP\\n            Source: CGA\\n            61. During April 2021, the Centre’s fiscal deficit stood at ₹78,699 crore, which is 5.2 per \\n            cent of BE and is lower than 5 year -moving average of 29 per cent of BE. Both the tax and \\n            non-tax revenue collection during April 2021 was much higher than April 2020 due to \\n            resumption of economic activities, and a lower base effect. The Net Tax Revenue to the Centre \\n            stood at ₹1.3 lakh crore in April 2021, relative to ₹21,412 crore in April 2020. Moreover, on \\n            the expenditure side, the total expenditure in April 2021 contracted by 26 percent relative to \\n            April last year. However, the focus on capital expenditure continued as it registered a 66.5 per \\n            cent YoY growth during April 2021. This will be pivotal in bringing back the economy on a \\n            high growth trajectory, thereby facilitating buoyant revenues and a sustainable fiscal path in \\n            the medium term. \\n            4.6\\n            6.7\\n            1.6\\n            11.6\\n            1.60\\n            9.2\\n            7.2\\n            1.1\\n            15.6\\n            2.2\\n            0\\n            2\\n            4\\n            6\\n            8\\n            10\\n            12\\n            14\\n            16\\n            18\\n            Fiscal Deficit Net Tax Revenue NonTax Revenue Revenue\\n            Expenditure\\n            Capital Expenditure\\n            As a per cent of GDP\\n            2019-20 2020-21PA33\\n            India’s dynamic public debt management strategy enabled Central and State \\n            governments to meet their increasing financial needs\\n            62.

As per fourth quarterly GDP estimates released by NSO, it is clearly evident that growth \\n            recovered steadily in H2: FY 2020-21, on the back of higher government expenditure, revival \\n            in private consumption and investment in the fourth quarter. The service sector too re-entered \\n            the positive territory of growth in the fourth quarter. The onset of the second wave of COVID\\x0219 since mid-February 2021 and localized or state-wide restrictions adopted to combat its \\n            spread, have posed a probable downside risk to the momentum in India’s economic recovery \\n            in the first quarter of 2021-22. With state-level lockdown restrictions being more adaptive to \\n            learnings from the first wave, manufacturing and construction activities are expected to \\n            experience a softer economic shock in the current quarter. However, the speed and scale of the \\n            second wave has created some downside risk as economy was still recovering from last year’s \\n            supply and demand shocks.\\n            67. India’s COVID-19 second wave situation has been improving lately with a continuous \\n            decline in 7-day average of active cases since 13th May 2021. Data shows that the second wave \\n            reached its peak of 7-day average of daily new cases around 8th May, with the pace of decline \\n            being as fast as the rise. The daily case positivity rate has plummeted sharply from 24.9 per \\n            cent in early May to reach 3.6 per cent as on 2nd June 2021 – below the WHO standard of 5 \\n            per cent. Concomitantly, high frequency indicators in real and financial sectors like power \\n            consumption, E-way bills and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows witnessed slight uptick \\n            in the second half of May 2021 after enduring the second wave driven contraction during April \\n            and first half of May. \\n            68. Economic activity is inextricably linked to the path of the pandemic. The intensity of \\n            the second wave could not be predicted by epidemiologists, which lends uncertainty to the \\n            trajectory of the pandemic in the subsequent part of the year. The continuous upscaling of \\n            India’s vaccination drive, meticulous observation of COVID-appropriate behaviour and pro\\x02active application of India’s successful first-wave pandemic management policies raises hopes \\n            that the impact of the second wave on the economy may not be very large. As we cautiously \\n            recuperate from the second wave, rapidly improving vaccination delivery and frontloading the \\n            fiscal measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment cycle in \\n            the coming quarters.

A ramp up in the pace and spread of vaccination on a war footing is critical to help \\n            India restrain the impact of the pandemic. Continued vigilance in terms of pandemic \\n            preparedness, upscaling health spending and health infrastructure, faster rollout of vaccines \\n            and vaccination; investing in research and development to guard against possible mutants of \\n            the virus, prudent and pre-emptive restrictions, and strict observance of COVID-appropriate \\n            behaviour are essential to maintain the delicate balance of lives and livelihoods. \\n            ****\\n            For any queries, you may contact the team: \\n            1.

India’s real GDP is estimated to grow at 0.5 per cent in Q3 and 1.6 \\n            per cent in Q4 of FY 2020-21 leading to an upward revision in annual real GDP growth from (-)8.0 \\n            per cent (2nd Advance Estimates) to (-)7.3 per cent in FY 2020-21. Gross value added (GVA) at basic \\n            prices for FY 2020-21 is estimated to grow at (-)6.2 per cent with agriculture & allied activities lending \\n            its unwavering support for economic recovery throughout the year. Given the large contribution of \\n            subsidies in Q3 and Q4, estimated GVA growth of 1.6 per cent in Q3 and 3.7 per cent in Q4 is more \\n            representative of economic performance in the second half of FY 2020-21. India is one of the select few \\n            economies that have witnessed positive YoY growth in the last two consecutive quarters.\\n            With a strong policy focus on infrastructure spending and construction in latter half of FY 2020-21, the \\n            ratio of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) to GDP reached 34.3 per cent, among the highest in \\n            over twenty-six quarters. Also, construction rebounded to grow at 14.5 per cent in Q4. As economic \\n            activity resumed following gradual unlocking and policy support, private consumption grew at 2.7 per \\n            cent after falling for three consecutive quarters. Moreover, contact-intensive hotels, trade and transport \\n            sectors contracted by only 2.3 per cent in Q4 after large declines in previous quarters. \\n            This momentum of economic recovery has, however, been moderated by the ravaging second wave of \\n            COVID-19. Unlike the first wave, the effect of the second wave has been asynchronous in its onset \\n            across states and wider in its spread as the second wave also entered the rural hinterland. This \\n            necessitated a differentiated, state-level policy response in close coordination with the Central \\n            Government for rapid rebooting of health infrastructure and effective implementation of ‘Test, Track, \\n            Treat, Vaccinate and COVID-appropriate behaviour’. A continuous decline in the 7-day average of \\n            active cases since 13th May 2021 and the 7-day average of daily new cases after 8th May marked the \\n            declining phase of the second wave. \\n            Simultaneously, the world’s largest vaccination drive is underway in India with 23.9 crore doses \\n            administered as on date. To avoid or lower the ferocity of subsequent waves, an accelerated vaccination \\n            drive is imperative. Vaccinating to achieve herd immunity (75-80 per cent of the population) will boost \\n            consumer and producer confidence and reinvigorate the engines of economic growth. For this purpose, \\n            challenges pertaining to vaccine supply, vaccine hesitancy, operational aspects to achieve high daily \\n            throughput, and widespread reach must be anticipated and planned for in advance.\\n            After declining during the second wave. high frequency indicators such as power consumption, E-way \\n            bills and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows witnessed uptick in the second half of May 2021. \\n            Agriculture sector continues to offer comfortable prospects amidst a normal monsoon forecast, smooth \\n            food procurement and distribution, and MGNREGA employment. However, sequential slackening was \\n            observed in eight core industrial output, PMI manufacturing, steel consumption, auto sales, tractor \\n            sales, petroleum products consumption, rail freight, port and air traffic, PMI services, highway toll \\n            collections, GST collections and UPI transactions. \\n            CPI inflation eased to 4.3 per cent in April 2021 (as against 7.2 per cent in April 2020) from 5.5 per \\n            cent in March 2021 driven by decline in food inflation and a favorable base effect. Going forward, the \\n            trajectory for CPI inflation may derive comfort from the forecast of a normal south-west monsoon but\\n            remains vulnerable to pressures arising from high international commodity prices and logistics costs \\n            across manufacturing and services. WPI inflation, however, increased to 10.5 per cent in April 2021 as \\n            compared to 7.4 per cent in March 2021 on account of increase in inflation of all major groups, viz, \\n            Primary articles, Fuel & power and Manufactured products and base effect.2\\n            On the external front, exports grew at 7.9 per cent in May 2021 over pre-COVID May 2019 levels, \\n            thereby reflecting export resilience amidst global economic recovery. However, domestic demand \\n            prospects remained tentative with imports declining by 17.5 per cent. India emerged as the preferred \\n            investment destination, attracting highest ever FDI inflow of USD 81.7 billion during the pandemic \\n            year FY 2020-21, particularly in computer software & hardware and infrastructure sectors. Bolstered \\n            by resurgent net foreign inflows, easing of the second wave and weakening dollar, the Indian Rupee \\n            made a strong comeback in May 2021 to reach INR/USD 72.8 and became the best performing Asian \\n            currency in the month. \\n            On the monetary side, money supply continued to rise by 9.9 per cent (YoY) as on 21st May 2021 driven \\n            by growth in aggregate deposits. Monthly growth in currency-in-circulation (CiC) which had begun to \\n            moderate in the second half of FY 20-21 picked up again in April and May 2021, suggestive of rise in \\n            precautionary demand for cash during the second wave, albeit lower than first wave levels. Bank credit \\n            YoY growth continued to remain muted at 6.0 per cent as on 21st May 2021. Growth of non-food credit \\n            at over 12.4 per cent over the corresponding period in FY 2019-20 is noteworthy given the policy\\x02driven focus on private investment. \\n            Financial conditions in May 2021 have remained conducive for economic recovery with systemic \\n            liquidity in surplus, continued accommodative monetary policy stance – as outlined in June 4 Monetary \\n            Policy statement - and unhindered efforts towards smooth policy transmission. To mitigate challenges \\n            of the second wave, RBI has further unveiled developmental and regulatory measures to ensure \\n            equitable liquidity support for affected sectors and financial stability. \\n            India’s dynamic public debt management strategy and RBI’s artillery of conventional and \\n            unconventional instruments like G-SAP 1.0 has enabled Central and State governments to meet their \\n            increasing financial needs amid the pandemic at low costs of borrowing and manageable levels of risk. \\n            The 10-year G-Sec yield stayed below 6 per cent despite the uncertainty engendered by the second wave. \\n            Corporate bond yields largely tracked G-sec market movements, reflecting policy rate transmission to \\n            corporate bond market and surplus liquidity conditions. Primary corporate bond market issuances \\n            increased by 13.4 per cent to a record Rs. 7.8 lakh crore during FY 2020-21. \\n            Driven by buoyant and broad-based growth in Centre's net revenue collections of 5.9 per cent for 2020-\\n            21 Provisional Actuals (PA) over 2020-21 Revised Estimates (RE) and nearly 5 per cent growth over \\n            2019-20, Centre's fiscal deficit for FY 2020-21 stood at 9.2 per cent of GDP for 2020-21 (PA), 0.3 \\n            percentage points lower than RE. Quality of expenditure crucially improved with capex in FY 2020-\\n            21(PA) registering a growth of 26 per cent over 2019-20 and 66.5 per cent in April 2021 over April \\n            2020.\\n            As we cautiously recuperate from the second wave, rapid vaccination and frontloading of the fiscal \\n            measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment, and thereby \\n            consumption, cycle in the coming quarters. As seen in Q4: FY 2020-21, where growth in capex \\n            generated positive spillovers for consumption, including in the contact-sensitive sectors, these steps \\n            would facilitate recovery post the second wave. Healthy monsoon forecasts bode well for continued \\n            momentum in agricultural growth. With state-level lockdown restrictions being more adaptive to \\n            learnings from the first wave, manufacturing and construction are expected to experience a softer \\n            economic shock in the current quarter. Quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination is critical to \\n            help India heal and regain the momentum of economic recovery.\\n            ******3\\n            India staged a V-shaped recovery in FY 2020-21\\n            1. As per the Provisional Estimates released by NSO, India’s GDP contracted at 7.3 per \\n            cent, which was an improvement over the Second Advance Estimate of a contraction of 8 per \\n            cent growth released in February 2021. This was largely due to the steady V-shaped recovery \\n            in India’s economy in the second half of FY: 2020-21. Monthly Economic Review, November \\n            2020, had stated that “This V-shaped recovery, evident at the half-way stage of 2020-21, \\n            reflects the resilience and robustness of the Indian economy”. This recovery is evident from \\n            the movement in various high-frequency indicators over the last year.\\n            2.

The growth in output in Q4 FY:2020-21 was broad-based across sectors. Agriculture, \\n            industry and services sector witnessed positive YoY growth during the quarter. The industrial \\n            sector grew at a 11-quarter high of 7.9 per cent aided by the higher output in manufacturing \\n            (6.9 per cent), electricity, gas, water & utility services (9.1 per cent) and construction (14.5 per \\n            cent). Only the mining and quarrying sector recorded negative growth during the quarter (-5.7 \\n            per cent).

Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India \\n            for containment and management of the pandemic. The vaccination drive has been sequentially \\n            expanded to cover the prioritized groups starting with Health Care Workers (HCWs) followed \\n            by Front Line Workers (FLWs), then the persons aged 60 years and above and those aged 45-\\n            59 years with identified 20 co-morbidities. Subsequently, from 1st April 2021, all persons aged \\n            45 years and above were eligible for vaccination. Such an approach has yielded positive results \\n            by achieving more than 81 per cent 1st dose coverage amongst registered HCWs and around 84 \\n            per cent coverage of 1st dose amongst registered FLWs thereby protecting these cohorts who \\n            are involved in providing Health Care Services, Surveillance and Containment activities amidst \\n            the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. \\n            12. As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the 'Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated \\n            National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy' was implemented from 1st May 2021 wherein all \\n            above the age of 18 became eligible for vaccination. 50 per cent of the available doses were \\n            earmarked for supply to States/UTs, as free of cost supply from the Central Government, while \\n            25 per cent each was available for direct procurement from the vaccine manufacturers by \\n            States/UTs and private hospitals. To streamline the process further, it has now been decided \\n            that the 25 per cent vaccination that was with states will also now be undertaken by the Central \\n            Government and provided free of cost to the State Government for rolling out wef 21st June. \\n            25 per cent vaccines being procured directly by the private hospitals will continue with only \\n            ₹150 service charge is levied by the private hospitals over the decided price of the vaccines. \\n            13. India has crossed the 23.9 crore mark in its cumulative COVID vaccination coverage. \\n            Around 14 percent of beneficiaries receiving the first dose are healthcare and frontline workers, \\n            33 percent are senior citizens, 38 percent belong to 45 to 60 years age group and 15 percent \\n            beneficiaries are of the age group 18-44 years. An analysis of the state wise proportion of \\n            population vaccinated relative to its share in total population indicates that Bihar, Uttar \\n            Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand need to ramp up their \\n            vaccination drive. Vaccination remains the key guard against subsequent waves and the \\n            coverage of the population needs to be enhanced across all States. \\n            State wise share of vaccination relative to population share \\n            Source: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\n            AP\\n            AS\\n            BR\\n            CT\\n            DL\\n            GJ\\n            HR\\n            JK JH\\n            KA\\n            KL\\n            MP\\n            MH\\n            OR\\n            PB\\n            RJ\\n            TN\\n            TG\\n            UT\\n            WB\\n            0%\\n            2%\\n            4%\\n            6%\\n            8%\\n            10%\\n            12%\\n            0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12%\\n            State share in total vaccination \\n            State share in total population \\n            On right track, keep going\\n            Should vaccinate more \\n            UP (17%,9%)10\\n            14. Global research on high efficacy of first dose of vaccine, non-depletion of the impact \\n            of the first dose despite a longer gap1\\n            , reduction of both symptomatic and asymptomatic \\n            infections after the first dose2\\n            and higher benefits accruing from first-dose-vaccination of a \\n            larger population to render community protection can help design an effective inoculation \\n            strategy. Canada’s approach of prioritising ‘first dose for all’ has been a successful one with \\n            only 0.15 per cent of Canadians getting infected after getting vaccinated3\\n            . \\n            Need to achieve herd immunity at the earliest for economic recovery\\n            Herd immunity is accomplished when 80 percent of the population is immune or less \\n            susceptible to infection. The key to regain the momentum of economic recovery is attainment \\n            of herd immunity at the earliest possible. As per India’s demographic distribution, 86.5 crore \\n            people or 63.1 per cent of the population is above 18 years of age. Assuming herd immunity \\n            at 80 per cent, the target population to be vaccinated is 70 crore. As on date, 19.2 crore people \\n            have got the first dose while 4.7 crore have been fully vaccinated. If 70 crore people must be \\n            vaccinated by September 2021, it is estimated that around 113 crore doses are needed (19\\n            crore for the second dose + 47 crore for two doses). \\n            With around 120 days to 31st September 2021, around 93 lakh vaccinations are required per \\n            day to achieve the herd immunity. The peak daily vaccination rate attained till date is 42.65 \\n            lakh. This peak was achieved using one shift of 8-9 hours of vaccination. So, doubling the \\n            shifts and possibly vaccinating 24x7 for a couple of months – particularly in August and \\n            September when supply is expected to increase significantly – can enable the ambitious, but \\n            possible, throughput of 1 crore shots a day.\\n            The challenges of the ‘push’ factors of ensuring adequate and timely supplies for the target \\n            population size and efficient and equitable distribution of sourced vaccines; ‘pull’ factors of \\n            overcoming vaccine hesitancy and streamlining of ‘operational issues’ in administering the \\n            vaccine at scale with the right guidelines and technology as the enabler, are required to be \\n            handled upfront.\\n            Vaccine manufacturers have been ramping up capacity and over 216 crore of doses are \\n            estimated to be manufactured in India during August-December 2021. Attempts are being \\n            made to fast-track procurement efforts of vaccines from the international market. The supply \\n            can be aligned with the target of September 2021 with people already having antibodies \\n            vaccinated later while people who have not been exposed given priority. \\n            Communication efforts ought to be ramped up to minimise vaccination hesitancy especially \\n            in rural areas. Using the principles of behavioural economics via tailored messaging to spur \\n            vaccination demand, outreach campaigns to show how only vaccination can help India get \\n            out of the current crisis, mass mobilisation to address concerns around vaccination and \\n            improved ease of access to availability of vaccine can go a long way in ‘pulling’ vaccination \\n            demand.

Use of technology to ease the administration \\n            of the vaccine, increased shifts at vaccination centres and integration of mass vaccination \\n            sites e.g., shopping areas, drive-ins, with schools and primary health care centres will \\n            enhance faster coverage under vaccination.\\n            Expansion of vaccination to achieve herd immunity (75-80 per cent of the population) will \\n            boost consumer and producer confidence and reinvigorate the engines of economic growth. \\n            Vaccination of the target population (70 crore) with atleast the first dose till September 2021, \\n            therefore, becomes paramount and must be taken up on a mission mode.\\n            15. Globally, the increased coverage of population under vaccination has been effective \\n            both in controlling the spread of covid and boosting mobility. It was emphasized in the Monthly \\n            Economic Review, March 2021, that ‘Vaccines are a key macro lever for domestic and global \\n            economic growth’. The second wave enveloped India with its severity and swiftness of spread \\n            signifying that quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination is critical. With a focus to \\n            avoid or lower the ferocity of any subsequent third wave, an accelerated vaccination drive is \\n            imperative. \\n            Global Overview – mixed trends giving reasons to both cheer and fear\\n            16. The waning of the second wave in India mirrored the trend across the globe. In May, \\n            COVID-19 new cases declined both in advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and \\n            developing economies (EMDEs). Vaccination progress remains highly uneven and as of now, \\n            around 11 percent and 6 percent of total world’s population have been partially and fully \\n            inoculated respectively. Advanced economies have administered more than 36 doses per\\n            hundred people, compared to only 6 in EMDEs till May 2021. \\n            17. Global economic recovery accelerated further in May with European economies \\n            opening, vaccinations soaring, and US and China leading the recovery. Strong demand for \\n            goods and rebound in services, buttressed by fiscal support by few large economies and easy \\n            monetary conditions, have kept investors optimistic and eased job markets. That said, the \\n            divergence in recovery and vaccinations, with Latin America, Africa, and some Asian countries \\n            lagging behind threatens an across-the-board recovery. Moreover, continued rise in prices (both \\n            for producers and consumers) signal need to avert overheating of economies.\\n            18. Global PMI continued its broad-based rise in May and accelerated to 15-year high at \\n            58.4, as new orders and international trade rose at stronger rates. US and UK led output growth \\n            rankings and output prices rose at series-record pace, offsetting the subdued activity in Asia \\n            region. The rate of increase in services activity outpaced that of manufacturing production for \\n            the second month in May since the current revival in global activity began last July. UK PMI \\n            saw the fastest private sector growth since 1998, with pent-up demand and labour market easing \\n            with loosening of movement restrictions. Eurozone PMI rose to a 39-months high, to 56.9, as \\n            economies mobility restrictions and demand surged to fastest in 15 years. Japanese PMI \\n            returned to contractionary zone as resurge in COVID Cases and reimposition of restrictions led \\n            to deterioration in business conditions, the decline being led by contraction in services sector.12\\n            Global PMI Composite Indices Commodity Prices\\n            Source: IHS Markit; May numbers are Flash Estimates Source: IMF\\n            Commodity and Inflation\\n            19. Commodity prices rose further due to rising demand and supply chain disruptions, with \\n            increasing signs of high input costs being passed to consumers. The IMF All Commodities \\n            index grew by 71.6 per cent YoY in April, led by rise in crude oil and natural gas prices. On a \\n            sequential basis, all commodities rose by 2.2 per cent, crude oil prices declined by a slight 1.5 \\n            per cent, while natural gas rose by 14 per cent, backed by lower than average temperatures in \\n            Europe. World food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade to \\n            hit their highest level since September 2011. Gold prices started rising on back of weakening \\n            dollar and lowering yields. Base metals prices rose consecutively for the twelfth month, with \\n            global manufacturing activity steadily expanding, dollar weakening, and concerns over \\n            resurging COVID-19 cases in South America (affecting copper prices). Rise in consumer price \\n            inflation in major economies occurred with the background of recovery in advanced \\n            economies, commodity price rise, supply disruptions, and easy fiscal and monetary conditions, \\n            fuelling concerns of overheating and future increase in interest rates.

Global trade remained resilient, with global commercial flight activity moderating \\n            slightly in May remaining broadly stable, and port activity improving further into April. The \\n            average daily number of international commercial flights in May was 132 per cent of previous \\n            year level. Global port activity in April rose by 4 per cent MoM and 19 per cent YoY, led by \\n            upturn in Europe as lockdowns opened up. However, high freight rates and container shortages \\n            continue to be supply-side challenges. WTO’s Goods Trade Barometer also points to an \\n            acceleration in trade recovery in March 2021, with export orders, electronic components, and \\n            air freight booking major gains, as indicated by commercial flight and port activity numbers \\n            earlier. \\n            21. UNCTAD’s Global Trade Update, May 2021 underscores the resilience of international \\n            trade, recovering steadily after a steep fall in Q2 2020, further rebounding in Q1 of 2021. Trade \\n            has rebounded more quickly for developing countries compared to developed countries. \\n            However, East Asian economies strong export performance constitute a large chunk of this \\n            growth, driving much of the trade recovery for developing countries. Trade in goods surpassed \\n            its pre-pandemic levels in Q1 2021, however, trade in services remains below Q1 2019 levels. \\n            During Q1 2021, trade continued to rebound not only in sectors related to COVID-19 (e.g. \\n            pharmaceuticals, communication and office equipment) but also increased for most other \\n            sectors, such as minerals and agri-food. For 2021, global trade is projected to grow by 16 per \\n            cent, but the outlook remains uncertain in view of uneven economic recovery, COVID induced \\n            additional borrowings by government and private parties, trade policy developments, reshoring \\n            and nearshoring trends, among others. \\n            Financial markets \\n            22. Global financial conditions fluctuated in May and stabilised around the last week. This \\n            was mainly due to inflationary pressures in the US and surging commodity prices, stoking \\n            anxieties of upcoming rise in interest rates and bond yields. Advanced economies recorded \\n            modest gains at May end, as US job data uplifted investors’ spirit, with Dow Jones closing 2 \\n            per cent higher. Asian stocks, as measured with MSCI Asia Pacific Index, dipped around mid\\x02May, with inflationary pressures and resurgence in COVID-19 cases taking a toll on investor \\n            sentiment, wiping off the year’s gains so far.\\n            International Commercial Flights (Nos.)

Emerging as the silver lining among the pandemic-hit economy, agricultural sector has \\n            cushioned the economic impact being the only sector posting growth in FY 2020-21. India's \\n            foodgrain production is estimated to rise 2.7 per cent to a new record of 305.43 million tonnes \\n            in the current crop year 2020-21, on record output of rice, wheat, maize and gram. Total pulses \\n            production has also posted a record at 25.58 million tonnes – a rise of 11.2 per cent over last \\n            year. In the non-foodgrain category, based on record production of groundnut and Rapeseed & \\n            Mustard, total oilseeds production touched a record of 36.57 million tonnes – 10.1 per cent rise \\n            over last year. With the prediction of a ‘normal’ monsoons this year, the government has set a \\n            record target to raise foodgrain production further to 307.31 million tonnes during 2021-22 \\n            crop year, starting July. The south-west monsoon knocked on the doors of India by hitting the \\n            coast of Kerala on June 3. \\n            25. Public procurement of rice and wheat during the year 2020-21 has been going smoothly. \\n            Against the target to buy 427.4 LMT of wheat for the central pool during 2021, a record \\n            procurement of 411.12 LMT has already been done with Punjab accounting for 33 per cent of \\n            the same. All States, including Punjab and Haryana, have switched from the system of indirect \\n            payment of MSP to direct online transfers of benefit to farmers bank accounts against sale of \\n            their crops – enabling the proceeds of public procurement of foodgrains directly into the bank \\n            accounts of the farmers under “One Nation, One MSP, One DBT”.

The banking system saw a rise in precautionary demand for currency led by COVID\\x0219 pandemic induced uncertainty. Demand for Currency in circulation (CiC), which constitutes \\n            about 82 per cent of Reserve Money (RM), normally expands during the first fortnight owing \\n            to transactions by households, followed by contraction in the second fortnight due to flow back \\n            of currency from households to the banking system. However, the unusual rise in month-over\\x02month CiC variation during April-June 2020 compared to the corresponding period of previous \\n            years clearly signalled an uncertainty-driven surge in precautionary demand for cash during a \\n            crisis situation. Subsequently, with the continuous decline in COVID-19 cases from mid\\x02September to February 2021, relaxation of COVID-19 related restrictions and optimism \\n            surrounding vaccination, movements in CiC were primarily due to seasonal factors like \\n            agricultural sowing and harvesting, festivals, state elections, etc. In May 21, CiC increased by \\n            1.92 per cent over April 21 compared to an increase of 1.1 per cent during the same period in \\n            pre-COVID year FY 2019-20, reflecting increase in demand for cash. \\n            Reserve Money and its components\\n            Source: RBI\\n            Money supply growth bolstered by aggregate deposits, bank credit growth remains muted\\n            48. Broad money(M3) rose by 11.8 per cent in FY 2020-21 as compared to 8.7 per cent in \\n            FY 2019-20, driven by aggregate deposits (11.4 per cent YoY) and time deposits (10.9 per cent \\n            YoY) in particular, suggestive of depositor risk-aversion. Trends in demand deposits (15.1 per \\n            cent YoY) tracked changes in currency with the public with the latter rising by 17.8 per cent in \\n            the pandemic year of FY 2020-21 compared to 14 per cent in FY 2019-20. Owing to shifting \\n            preferences towards precautionary cash savings in the uncertain pandemic year, currency\\x02deposit ratio stood at 17.3 per cent in FY 2020-21 as compared to 16.3 per cent in FY 2019-20 \\n            and slightly above its decennial average (2011-20) of 15.2 per cent.

SCBs’ credit-deposit ratio declined\\n            to 72.4 per cent in FY 2020-21 compared to 76.4 per cent a year ago. Bank credit growth started \\n            picking pace gradually in the second half of the year as the economy unlocked and the RBI and \\n            Government led stimulus measures started demonstrating positive effects. Bank credit stood at \\n            5.6 per cent on a YoY basis for FY 2020-21 as compared with 6.1 per cent a year ago. While \\n            decline in credit growth in the year was broad-based on a sectoral basis, credit growth to \\n            agriculture (12.3 per cent), medium industries (28.8 per cent) and wholesale trade services \\n            (21.2 per cent) remained healthy. Credit to infrastructure also improved marginally (3.6 per \\n            cent) while personal loans growth remained in double digits (10.2 per cent). As on 21st May \\n            2021, bank credit growth stood at ₹108.34 lakh crore, declining by 0.3 per cent over the \\n            previous fortnight and growing at 6.0 per cent over the previous year. \\n            Bond yields softened across market segments and spreads narrowed\\n            Government Securities Market\\n            50. Tracking the continuum of unprecedented measures announced by RBI during FY \\n            2020-21 towards ensuring smooth monetary transmission, credit flows and fostering orderly \\n            market conditions, bond yields softened across market segments and spreads narrowed to pre\\x02COVID levels by end of January 2021. The benchmark 10-year yield, which had averaged 5.97 \\n            per cent from April 2020 to January 2021, surged to 6.22 per cent at end February 2021 and \\n            remained elevated at 6.13 per cent at end March 2021. This was driven by Central \\n            government’s announcement of additional borrowing of ₹80,000 crore for FY 2020-21 and \\n            elevated borrowing of ₹12.06 lakh crore for FY 2021-22. Additionally, increase in US Treasury \\n            yields and hardening of crude oil prices also contributed to the elevated bond yields. \\n            51. Introduction of the secondary market G-sec acquisition programme (G-SAP) in \\n            FY 2021-22 with an upfront commitment to a specific amount for open market purchases of \\n            G-secs exemplifies RBI’s continued efforts at ensuring a stable and orderly evolution of the \\n            yield curve under supportive financial conditions. Under G-SAP 1.0, RBI conducted the first \\n            tranche on 15 April 2021 in which it bought the entire notified amount of ₹25,000 crore. RBI \\n            conducted the second purchase for an aggregate amount of ₹35,000 crore on 20 May 2021. \\n            Enabled by G-SAP, India’s benchmark 10-year G-Sec yield eased to 5.99 per cent at end-May \\n            2021. RBI has announced another G-SAP 1.0 auction for purchase of G-Secs of ₹40,000 crore \\n            to be conducted on June 17, 2021 of which ₹10,000 crore would constitute purchase of state \\n            development loans (SDLs). Under G-SAP 2.0, secondary market purchase operations of ₹1.2 \\n            lakh crore will be conducted in Q2 of FY 2021-22. Apart from G-SAP, the RBI also introduced \\n            several regulatory measures to promote financial inclusion and enable payments banks to reach \\n            a wider subscriber base by enhancing the operational and liquidity limits allotted to them. \\n            Corporate bond market\\n            52. Triggered by COVID-19 outbreak, corporate bond yields stiffened in March-April 2020 \\n            with AAA rated 10-year bond yield reaching 7.3 per cent in April 2020. However, corporate \\n            bond yields significantly eased during FY 2020-21 to reach 6.7 per cent in January 2021 and \\n            closed at 7.1 per cent in March 2021. Movements in corporate bond markets largely mirrored \\n            G-sec market movements, reflecting the transmission of policy rate cuts to the corporate bond \\n            yields, surplus liquidity conditions and the effect of Government and RBI’s targeted measures. \\n            Tracking the movement in 10 year G-sec yield, 10 year AAA rated corporate bond yields too \\n            eased to reach 6.7 per cent in May 2021. The spread between corporate bond yields and 26\\n            corresponding G-sec yields also witnessed moderation across all periods of residual maturity. \\n            On the back of softening yields and easy financing conditions, primary corporate bond market \\n            issuances increased by 13.4 per cent to a record ₹7.8 lakh crore during FY 2020-21.

The Provisional Actuals (PA) data for the year 2020-21 released by the O/o of CGA \\n            highlights that the fiscal deficit for 2020-21 stood at ₹18.2 lakh crore which is 9.2 per cent of \\n            GDP – 0.3 points lower than estimated at RE stage. This lower Fiscal deficit is clearly due to \\n            buoyant revenue collections. The Net tax Revenue to the Centre showed an increase of 5.9 per \\n            cent in 2020-21 PA over RE. This was due to an improved collection observed under all the \\n            major tax revenue heads compared to the Revised estimates. Among the direct taxes, \\n            Corporation tax registered a growth of 2.5 per cent over RE and other taxes on income \\n            registered a growth of 5.9 per cent over RE. The improvement in indirect taxes (PA) over the \\n            Revised estimates, was also broad-based, as Customs, Excise duties and GST collections \\n            (Centre) turned out to be 120.3 per cent, 107.9 per cent and 106.5 per cent of RE respectively. \\n            Growth in fiscal indicators for 2020-21 (PA) over 2020-21 RE\\n            Source: CGA\\n            59.

Income tax collections for 2020-21 surpassed corporate tax collections by a \\n            marginal amount. The non-tax revenue also displayed a negative growth of 36.4 per cent in \\n            2020-21(PA) over 2019-20, largely led by dividends and profits which were 48 per cent lower \\n            than previous year. The disinvestment receipts during 2020-21(PA), which stood at nearly \\n            three-fourth of its corresponding collection during 2019-20, showed a marginal improvement \\n            of around ₹6000 crore over the target envisaged in the RE.\\n            60. On the expenditure side, the 2.5 per cent growth in revenue expenditure in 2020-21(PA) \\n            over the RE level, was largely driven by growth in expenditure on Food subsidy. The subsidy \\n            bill for the Centre went up by 202 per cent during 2020-21 PA over the previous year, on \\n            account of higher requirements of food and fertilizer subsidy due to the pandemic. Further, the \\n            emphasis on improving the quality of expenditure during the pandemic year can be seen as the \\n            capex in 2020-21(PA) registered a growth of 26 per cent over 2019-20 and reached 2.2 per cent \\n            of GDP. On comparing the accounts of 2020-21(PA) with 2019-20, it may be seen that the \\n            Fiscal deficit has doubled from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 9.2 per cent of GDP in 2020-\\n            21 PA. In terms of per cent of GDP, this entire increase in Fiscal deficit is equal to the increase \\n            in total expenditure in 2020-21(PA) over 2019-20. The higher expenditure requirements in FY \\n            2020-21 can be attributed towards various support/relief measures to mitigate the impact of \\n            pandemic and to the steps taken for enhancing the transparency in fiscal accounts.\\n            Fiscal indicators as a per cent of GDP\\n            Source: CGA\\n            61. During April 2021, the Centre’s fiscal deficit stood at ₹78,699 crore, which is 5.2 per \\n            cent of BE and is lower than 5 year -moving average of 29 per cent of BE. Both the tax and \\n            non-tax revenue collection during April 2021 was much higher than April 2020 due to \\n            resumption of economic activities, and a lower base effect. The Net Tax Revenue to the Centre \\n            stood at ₹1.3 lakh crore in April 2021, relative to ₹21,412 crore in April 2020. Moreover, on \\n            the expenditure side, the total expenditure in April 2021 contracted by 26 percent relative to \\n            April last year. However, the focus on capital expenditure continued as it registered a 66.5 per \\n            cent YoY growth during April 2021. This will be pivotal in bringing back the economy on a \\n            high growth trajectory, thereby facilitating buoyant revenues and a sustainable fiscal path in \\n            the medium term. \\n            4.6\\n            6.7\\n            1.6\\n            11.6\\n            1.60\\n            9.2\\n            7.2\\n            1.1\\n            15.6\\n            2.2\\n            0\\n            2\\n            4\\n            6\\n            8\\n            10\\n            12\\n            14\\n            16\\n            18\\n            Fiscal Deficit Net Tax Revenue NonTax Revenue Revenue\\n            Expenditure\\n            Capital Expenditure\\n            As a per cent of GDP\\n            2019-20 2020-21PA33\\n            India’s dynamic public debt management strategy enabled Central and State \\n            governments to meet their increasing financial needs\\n            62.

As per fourth quarterly GDP estimates released by NSO, it is clearly evident that growth \\n            recovered steadily in H2: FY 2020-21, on the back of higher government expenditure, revival \\n            in private consumption and investment in the fourth quarter. The service sector too re-entered \\n            the positive territory of growth in the fourth quarter. The onset of the second wave of COVID\\x0219 since mid-February 2021 and localized or state-wide restrictions adopted to combat its \\n            spread, have posed a probable downside risk to the momentum in India’s economic recovery \\n            in the first quarter of 2021-22. With state-level lockdown restrictions being more adaptive to \\n            learnings from the first wave, manufacturing and construction activities are expected to \\n            experience a softer economic shock in the current quarter. However, the speed and scale of the \\n            second wave has created some downside risk as economy was still recovering from last year’s \\n            supply and demand shocks.\\n            67. India’s COVID-19 second wave situation has been improving lately with a continuous \\n            decline in 7-day average of active cases since 13th May 2021. Data shows that the second wave \\n            reached its peak of 7-day average of daily new cases around 8th May, with the pace of decline \\n            being as fast as the rise. The daily case positivity rate has plummeted sharply from 24.9 per \\n            cent in early May to reach 3.6 per cent as on 2nd June 2021 – below the WHO standard of 5 \\n            per cent. Concomitantly, high frequency indicators in real and financial sectors like power \\n            consumption, E-way bills and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows witnessed slight uptick \\n            in the second half of May 2021 after enduring the second wave driven contraction during April \\n            and first half of May. \\n            68. Economic activity is inextricably linked to the path of the pandemic. The intensity of \\n            the second wave could not be predicted by epidemiologists, which lends uncertainty to the \\n            trajectory of the pandemic in the subsequent part of the year. The continuous upscaling of \\n            India’s vaccination drive, meticulous observation of COVID-appropriate behaviour and pro\\x02active application of India’s successful first-wave pandemic management policies raises hopes \\n            that the impact of the second wave on the economy may not be very large. As we cautiously \\n            recuperate from the second wave, rapidly improving vaccination delivery and frontloading the \\n            fiscal measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment cycle in \\n            the coming quarters. As seen in Q4: FY 2020-21, where growth in capex generated positive \\n            0\\n            1\\n            2\\n            3\\n            4\\n            5\\n            6\\n            7\\n            8\\n            9\\n            10\\n            2014-15\\n            2015-16\\n            2016-17\\n            2017-18\\n            2018-19\\n            2019-20\\n            2020-21\\n            (upto May 28)\\n            Rs. lakh crore\\n            Gross Net\\n            0\\n            1\\n            2\\n            3\\n            4\\n            5\\n            6\\n            7\\n            2014-15\\n            2015-16\\n            2016-17\\n            2017-18\\n            2018-19\\n            2019-20\\n            2020-21\\n            (upto May 28)\\n            Rs. lakh crore\\n            Gross Net35\\n            spillovers for consumption, including in the contact-sensitive sectors, these steps would \\n            facilitate recovery post the second wave. Healthy monsoon forecasts bode well for continued \\n            momentum in agricultural growth. \\n            69. A ramp up in the pace and spread of vaccination on a war footing is critical to help \\n            India restrain the impact of the pandemic. Continued vigilance in terms of pandemic \\n            preparedness, upscaling health spending and health infrastructure, faster rollout of vaccines \\n            and vaccination; investing in research and development to guard against possible mutants of \\n            the virus, prudent and pre-emptive restrictions, and strict observance of COVID-appropriate \\n            behaviour are essential to maintain the delicate balance of lives and livelihoods. \\n            ****\\n            For any queries, you may contact the team: \\n            1.
